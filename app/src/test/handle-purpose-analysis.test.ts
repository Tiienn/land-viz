    // Option A: Handles stay axis-aligned (always horizontal/vertical)
    // - Handles don't rotate with the shape
    // - Dragging changes the overall bounding box
    // - This is how some simple tools work
    
    // Option B: Handles rotate with the shape (parallel to edges)
    // - Handles align with the rotated shape edges
    // - Dragging resizes along the actual shape dimensions
    // - This is how professional tools like Canva, Adobe work
    
    // The user specifically said "parallel to the line its on" and showed Canva

    // 1. VISUAL orientation (how the handle LOOKS)

    // 2. FUNCTIONAL orientation (what direction the handle allows resizing)
    //    - The handle should allow resizing perpendicular to the edge
    //    - This is how the dragging behavior works
