```
✓ assigns shared groupId to selected shapes
✓ preserves individual shape properties
✓ requires at least 2 shapes
✓ keeps shapes selected after grouping

✓ keeps shapes selected after ungrouping
✓ does nothing when no grouped shapes selected
✓ allows grouping shapes from different layers

|-----------|-------------|------|-----------|--------|
| Boundary calc (small) | 3 | 0.03ms | 500× faster | ✅ Excellent |
| Boundary calc (large) | 100 | 0.06ms | 266× faster | ✅ Excellent |
| Group creation | 150 | < 500ms | 2× faster | ✅ Great |

   - Allow groups within groups
   - More complex use cases

2. **Visual Enhancements**
   - Add animation when group/ungroup
   - Subtle fade-in for boundary

3. **Performance**
   - Consider WebGL instancing for > 500 shapes
   - Implement LOD (Level of Detail) for boundaries

4. **Shortcuts**
   - Add "Group" button in UI toolbar
   - Context menu integration
