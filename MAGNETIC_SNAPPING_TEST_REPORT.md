# Magnetic Snapping Functionality Test Report

## üéØ Overview
This document provides comprehensive testing details for the magnetic snapping functionality in the Land Visualizer's Canva-style equal spacing distribution system.

## üìã Test Summary

**Status**: ‚úÖ **Implementation Analysis Complete**
**Server**: Running on localhost:5175
**Key Feature**: Magnetic snapping to purple dashed alignment lines controlled by Snap toggle

---

## üîç Code Analysis Results

### Implementation Details Found:

1. **Main Control Logic** (useAppStore.ts:1629):
   ```typescript
   if (result.snapPosition && state.drawing.snapping?.config?.activeTypes?.size > 0) {
   ```
   - Magnetic snapping is controlled by `state.drawing.snapping.config.activeTypes.size > 0`
   - This should correspond to the Snap toggle state

2. **Snap Threshold**: 8 meters (8-meter detection range for magnetic snapping)

3. **Visual Components**:
   - **Purple dashed lines**: Always shown for shape sequences
   - **Green snap indicators**: Only shown when snapping is active
   - **"SNAP" confirmation badge**: Appears during magnetic attraction

---

## üß™ Expected Test Results

### Scenario 1: Snap Toggle OFF
**Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Purple dashed alignment lines appear for shape sequences
- ‚úÖ Shapes can be dragged freely near purple lines
- ‚ùå **NO magnetic attraction** to purple lines
- ‚ùå **NO green "SNAP" badge** appears
- ‚úÖ Purple spacing badges show distance measurements

### Scenario 2: Snap Toggle ON
**Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Purple dashed alignment lines appear for shape sequences
- ‚úÖ Shapes **magnetically snap** to purple lines when dragged within 8 meters
- ‚úÖ **Green "SNAP" confirmation badge** appears during snapping
- ‚úÖ Green cross indicators appear at snap positions
- ‚úÖ Purple spacing badges show distance measurements

## üîß Manual Testing Instructions

### Pre-Test Setup:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5175
2. Ensure the development server is running
3. Open browser developer console to check for errors

### Test Steps:

#### Step 1: Create Test Scenario
1. Select **Rectangle tool**
2. Create **3 rectangles** in a horizontal line
3. Space them roughly equally (about 5-10 meters apart)
4. Select **Select tool** to exit drawing mode

#### Step 2: Test Snap OFF
1. Click **Grid button** to ensure it shows **"Free move"** (Snap OFF)
2. Select middle rectangle and drag it to disturb alignment
3. Drag it back toward the alignment line
4. **Verify**: Purple dashed lines appear but shape does NOT snap
5. **Verify**: NO green "SNAP" badge appears

#### Step 3: Test Snap ON
1. Click **Grid button** to show **"1m snap"** (Snap ON)
2. Select middle rectangle and drag it to disturb alignment
3. Drag it back toward the alignment line
4. **Verify**: Shape magnetically snaps to purple line when close
5. **Verify**: Green "SNAP" badge appears during snapping
6. **Verify**: Green cross indicators appear at snap position

#### Step 4: Test Vertical Alignment
1. Create 3 rectangles in a **vertical column**
2. Repeat Snap OFF/ON tests
3. Verify vertical alignment guides work the same way

## üé® Visual Indicators Guide

### Purple Elements (Always Present):
- **Purple dashed lines** (#8B5CF6): Alignment guides for equal spacing
- **Purple spacing badges**: Distance measurements between shapes

### Green Elements (Only When Snapping):
- **Green cross indicators** (#10B981): Mark exact snap positions
- **Green "SNAP" badge**: Confirmation of magnetic attraction
- **Green snap lines**: Connect shape to snap position

## üêõ Potential Issues to Check

### Critical Issues:
- [ ] Magnetic snapping occurs when Snap is OFF
- [ ] No magnetic snapping when Snap is ON
- [ ] Purple alignment lines don't appear for sequences
- [ ] Green "SNAP" badge doesn't appear during snapping

### UI Issues:
- [ ] Snap toggle doesn't change from "Free move" to "1m snap"
- [ ] Purple spacing badges show incorrect measurements
- [ ] Visual indicators have wrong colors

### Performance Issues:
- [ ] Console errors during drag operations
- [ ] Lag or stuttering during shape dragging
- [ ] Alignment detection fails intermittently

---

## üî¨ Technical Implementation Details

### Key Files:
- `useAppStore.ts` (lines 1624-1680): Main drag logic and snap control
- `SimpleAlignmentGuides.tsx`: Visual rendering of guides and indicators
- `simpleAlignment.ts`: Alignment detection and snap position calculation
- `alignmentService.ts`: Legacy alignment system (currently disabled)

### Control Flow:
1. **Drag Start**: Initialize drag state and original positions
2. **Drag Continue**:
   - Detect alignment sequences using `SimpleAlignment.detectAlignments()`
   - Calculate snap position if sequences found
   - Apply magnetic snapping only if `activeTypes.size > 0`
   - Update visual guides and spacing measurements
3. **Drag End**: Clear alignment guides and snap positions

### Snap Toggle Connection:
- The Snap toggle controls `state.drawing.snapping.config.activeTypes`
- When OFF: `activeTypes = new Set()` (size = 0)
- When ON: `activeTypes = new Set(['grid'])` (size = 1)

## üìä Test Completion Checklist

### Basic Functionality:
- [ ] Server runs without errors on localhost:5175
- [ ] Can create shapes with drawing tools
- [ ] Snap toggle changes UI text between "Free move" and "1m snap"
- [ ] Purple alignment lines appear for 3+ aligned shapes

### Magnetic Snapping - Snap OFF:
- [ ] No magnetic attraction to purple lines
- [ ] Shapes drag freely near alignment guides
- [ ] No green "SNAP" badge appears
- [ ] Purple spacing badges still show measurements

### Magnetic Snapping - Snap ON:
- [ ] Shapes snap to purple lines when dragged close (within 8m)
- [ ] Green "SNAP" badge appears during magnetic attraction
- [ ] Green cross indicators appear at snap positions
- [ ] Snapping works for both horizontal and vertical alignments

### Edge Cases:
- [ ] Grid snapping and shape snapping work together
- [ ] Multiple shape sequences detected correctly
- [ ] Snap threshold (8 meters) works as expected
- [ ] Performance remains smooth during complex alignments

## üöÄ Success Criteria

The magnetic snapping feature is **working correctly** if:

1. **Conditional Behavior**: Magnetic snapping ONLY occurs when Snap toggle is ON
2. **Visual Feedback**: Green "SNAP" badge and indicators appear during snapping
3. **Consistent Guides**: Purple dashed lines appear regardless of snap state
4. **Accurate Measurements**: Spacing badges show correct distances
5. **Performance**: Smooth dragging with no console errors

---

## üìù Notes for Developer

- The implementation uses a sophisticated alignment detection system
- Magnetic snapping is separate from visual guide rendering
- The 8-meter threshold prevents overly sensitive snapping
- Green visual feedback is crucial for user experience
- Both grid snapping and shape snapping can be active simultaneously

**Test Status**: Ready for manual verification
**Next Steps**: Run manual tests following this guide and report any discrepancies
