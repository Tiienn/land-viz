## Workflow Success Metrics

Track these for each workflow:

- **Time to Completion**: How long from start to deployment
- **Agent Efficiency**: Number of agents used vs needed
- **Rework Rate**: How often agent output needs revision
- **Parallelization**: % of tasks run in parallel
- **Quality Score**: Bugs found post-implementation

---

## Tips for Effective Workflows

1. **Start with Strategy**: Always begin with `@strategy-analyzer` for complex features
2. **Parallel When Possible**: Run independent agents simultaneously
3. **Test Early**: Include `@test-automation` throughout, not just at the end
4. **Review Often**: Use `@design-review` at milestones
5. **Document Everything**: End with `@land-documentation-generator`
