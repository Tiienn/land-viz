## üöÄ How to Use These Agents

### Automatic Invocation
Claude Code will automatically delegate to the appropriate agent based on your task. Simply describe what you need:

```
"I need to calculate the precise area of this property boundary"
‚Üí Automatically uses geospatial-processor

"The 3D scene is lagging on mobile devices"
‚Üí Automatically uses performance-optimizer

"Create tests for the new export feature"
‚Üí Automatically uses test-automation
```

### Explicit Invocation
You can also explicitly request a specific agent:

```
"Use the chili3d-integration agent to set up STEP export"
"Ask the ui-ux-designer to create a new toolbar design"
```
