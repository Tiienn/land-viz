## üöÄ How to Use

### Installation

These skills are already installed in the project. Claude Code will automatically load them when relevant to your task.

### Verification

To verify the skills are available:

```bash
# List all skills
ls -la .claude/skills/

# Check a specific skill
cat .claude/skills/geospatial-processor/SKILL.md | head -20
```

### Activation

Skills are activated automatically when Claude detects relevant work. You can also explicitly invoke a skill:

```
"Use the geospatial-processor skill to help me convert coordinates from WGS84 to UTM"
```

## üìñ Skill Structure

Each skill follows this structure:

```
skill-name/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SKILL.md           # Required: Main skill file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ REFERENCE.md       # Optional: Extended documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ resources/         # Optional: Supporting files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/          # Optional: Executable code
```

### SKILL.md Format

```markdown
---
name: "Skill Name"
description: "Brief description of what the skill does (max 200 chars)"
version: "1.0.0"
dependencies:
  - "package@version"
---

# Skill content in markdown...
```

## üîÑ Updating Skills

To update a skill:

1. Edit the appropriate `SKILL.md` file
2. Update the `version` field in the frontmatter
3. Document changes in the skill content
4. Restart Claude Code to reload skills

## üéØ Skill Composition

Skills are designed to work together automatically. For example:

- **Geospatial Processor** + **3D Scene Specialist** = Accurate 3D property visualization
- **Land Viz Specialist** + **UI/UX Designer** = Beautiful, functional drawing tools
- **Performance Optimizer** + **Test Automation** = High-performance, tested code

## üìä Coverage Matrix

| Feature Area | Primary Skill | Supporting Skills |
|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Coordinate Systems | Geospatial Processor | - |
| 3D Rendering | 3D Scene Specialist | Performance Optimizer |
| Drawing Tools | Land Viz Specialist | UI/UX Designer |
| Measurements | Land Viz Specialist | Geospatial Processor |
| Visual Design | UI/UX Designer | - |
| Performance | Performance Optimizer | 3D Scene Specialist |
| Testing | Test Automation | All skills |

## üîß Development Guidelines

### Creating New Skills

1. **Create directory**: `.claude/skills/new-skill-name/`
2. **Create SKILL.md** with proper frontmatter
3. **Write focused content** (one domain per skill)
4. **Test the skill** by asking Claude to use it
5. **Document usage** in this README

### Best Practices

1. **Keep skills focused** - One domain per skill
2. **Write clear descriptions** - Claude uses this to decide when to load the skill
3. **Include examples** - Show code patterns and usage
4. **Update versions** - Increment version on changes
5. **Test regularly** - Ensure skills load correctly

## üìù Skill Maintenance

### Regular Updates

- Review skills quarterly for relevance
- Update dependencies to latest versions
- Add new patterns as project evolves
- Remove outdated information
