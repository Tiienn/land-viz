# Feature Specification: Export Functionality

**Feature Name:** Multi-Format Export System
**Date:** January 2025
**Status:** Ready for Implementation

## User Story

As a Land Visualizer user, I want to export my drawn shapes and measurements to various file formats so that I can use the data in other applications, share with colleagues, and create professional reports.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Users can export to Excel (.xlsx) format with all measurements and coordinates
- [ ] Users can export to DXF format for CAD software compatibility
- [ ] Users can export to PDF with visual representation and data tables
- [ ] Users can export to GeoJSON for GIS applications
- [ ] Export dialog shows preview of what will be exported
- [ ] Export includes metadata (creation date, units, project name)
- [ ] All exports maintain precision to 0.01% accuracy
- [ ] Export process provides feedback (progress, success, errors)

## Functional Requirements

### Core Requirements

1. **Export Dialog Interface**
   - Triggered by clicking "Excel Export" button in ribbon (already exists)
   - Modal dialog with format selection
   - Preview panel showing what will be exported
   - Settings for each format type
   - AMBIGUITY: Should dialog close automatically after export?

2. **Excel Export (.xlsx)**
   - Sheet 1: Summary (total area, perimeter, shape count)
   - Sheet 2: Shape Details (ID, type, area, perimeter, coordinates)
   - Sheet 3: Coordinates (detailed vertex information)
   - Formatted with headers, borders, and appropriate number formats
   - Include project metadata in header rows

3. **DXF Export (CAD)**
   - Convert shapes to DXF entities (POLYLINE, CIRCLE)
   - Maintain exact coordinates and dimensions
   - Include layers for different shape types
   - Support both 2D and potential future 3D exports
   - AMBIGUITY: Which DXF version to target? (Recommend AutoCAD 2018)

4. **PDF Export**
   - Page 1: Visual representation of the scene
   - Page 2+: Data tables with measurements
   - Include project title, date, and metadata
   - Professional layout with company branding option
   - AMBIGUITY: A4 or Letter size default?

5. **GeoJSON Export**
   - Standard GeoJSON format with FeatureCollection
   - Include properties for each feature (area, perimeter, etc.)
   - Support coordinate system specification
   - Valid for import into QGIS, ArcGIS, etc.

### Edge Cases

- Empty scene (no shapes drawn)
- Very large number of shapes (>1000)
- Shapes with many vertices (complex polylines)
- Invalid or self-intersecting polygons
- Export interruption or failure
- File system permissions issues

## Technical Constraints

Based on constitution.md:
- Must use inline styles only for UI components
- Must integrate with existing Zustand store
- Must maintain 60 FPS performance during export
- Must follow TypeScript strict mode
- No external API calls (client-side only)
- Use existing services pattern

## User Interface

### Visual Design
- Modal dialog matching existing Canva-inspired design
- Gradient buttons for action items
- Smooth 200ms transitions for dialog open/close
- Progress indicator during export
- Success/error notifications

### User Flow
1. User clicks "Excel Export" button in ribbon
2. Export dialog opens with format selection
3. User selects format and configures options
4. User clicks "Export" button
5. Progress indicator shows during processing
6. File downloads automatically
7. Success notification appears
8. Dialog closes (or stays open for multiple exports)

## Testing Scenarios

### Happy Path
- Export single rectangle to Excel
- Export multiple shapes to DXF
- Export complex polyline to PDF
- Export all shapes to GeoJSON
- Change settings and re-export

### Error Cases
- Attempt export with no shapes
- Cancel export mid-process
- Export with invalid file name
- Insufficient browser storage
- File download blocked by browser

## Implementation Notes

### Libraries to Consider
- **Excel**: xlsx or exceljs library
- **PDF**: jsPDF with autoTable plugin
- **DXF**: dxf-writer or custom implementation
- **GeoJSON**: Native JSON (no library needed)

### Performance Considerations
- Large exports should be chunked
- Use Web Workers for heavy processing
- Show progress for long operations
- Implement cancelable exports
