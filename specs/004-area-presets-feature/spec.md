# Feature Specification: Area Configuration Presets

**Spec ID**: 004
**Feature Name**: Area Configuration Presets
**Created**: 2025-09-18
**Status**: Draft
**Priority**: Medium
**Estimated Effort**: 10 hours
**Dependencies**: Add Area Feature (Spec 003)

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive Presets feature in the Area Configuration section of the toolbar that provides users with quick access to commonly used area sizes. The feature will integrate seamlessly with the existing AddArea system and offer categorized presets for different land use types.

## Problem Statement

Currently, users must manually enter area values and configure shape types every time they want to create common area sizes. This creates friction when working with standard lot sizes, commercial plots, or agricultural parcels that follow industry conventions.

## User Stories

### Primary User Story
**As a** land planner/surveyor
**I want to** quickly select from common area presets
**So that** I can rapidly create standard-sized parcels without manual input

### Secondary User Stories
- **As a** residential developer, I want to access typical residential lot sizes (0.25 acre, 0.5 acre, 1 acre)
- **As a** commercial planner, I want quick access to standard commercial plot sizes (5000 sqft, 10000 sqft, 1 hectare)
- **As a** agricultural planner, I want to create common farm plot sizes (1 hectare, 5 hectares, 10 hectares)
- **As a** user, I want to save my frequently used area configurations as custom presets
- **As a** user, I want to search and filter presets by category or size

## Functional Requirements

### UI2: Preset Cards
- **UI2.1**: Each preset card displays:
  - Area value with unit prominently
  - Shape type icon (square, rectangle, circle)
  - Brief description
  - Preview dimensions (width x height or radius)
- **UI2.2**: Hover effects and selection states
- **UI2.3**: Clear visual hierarchy and readability

### UI3: Navigation
- **UI3.1**: Category tabs at top of modal

- **UI3.3**: Action buttons (Use Preset, Customize, Cancel) at bottom
- **UI3.4**: Loading states during shape creation

## Technical Requirements

### TR1: Data Structure
- **TR1.1**: Preset data structure includes: id, name, area, unit, shapeType, aspectRatio, description, category
- **TR1.2**: Category enumeration: 'residential' | 'commercial' | 'agricultural' | 'mixed' | 'custom'
- **TR1.3**: Presets stored as static dataset with custom presets in localStorage

### TR2: State Management

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- Add Area Feature (Spec 003) - Must be fully implemented
- Existing useAppStore area creation actions
- AddArea modal and validation system

### External Dependencies
- None (purely internal feature)

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Performance Impact
**Risk**: Large preset dataset could slow modal loading
**Mitigation**: Lazy loading, virtual scrolling for large lists

### Risk 2: Storage Limits
**Risk**: Custom presets could exceed localStorage limits
**Mitigation**: Implement preset cleanup and storage management

### Risk 3: User Confusion
**Risk**: Too many preset options could overwhelm users
**Mitigation**: Clear categorization, search, and progressive disclosure

## Success Metrics

- **Adoption Rate**: 60%+ of area creation uses presets within 30 days
- **Time Savings**: Average area creation time reduced by 40%
- **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback on preset utility and organization
- **Technical Performance**: Modal load time < 100ms consistently

## AMBIGUITIES

1. **AMBIGUITY**: Should presets include non-standard aspect ratios (e.g., 3:1 rectangles)?
2. **AMBIGUITY**: How many custom presets should be allowed per user?
3. **AMBIGUITY**: Should preset area values be displayed in multiple units simultaneously?
4. **AMBIGUITY**: Should there be preset templates for specific countries/regions?
