# Feature Specification: Smart Alignment Guide System

**Specification ID**: 003
**Feature Name**: Smart Alignment Guide System
**Created**: September 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Priority**: High

## Executive Summary

Implementation of an intelligent visual alignment guide system that provides real-time feedback during shape manipulation, similar to professional design tools like Canva. The system will automatically detect alignment opportunities, display visual guides, and show spacing measurements between objects.

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points
- Users must manually align shapes using button controls without visual feedback
- No indication when shapes are aligned or evenly spaced
- Difficult to maintain consistent spacing between multiple objects
- Time-consuming to create professional layouts
- No visual confirmation of alignment during drag operations

### User Impact
- **Surveyors**: Need precise alignment for property boundaries
- **Designers**: Want quick, professional layouts
- **Planners**: Require consistent spacing for site planning
- **Mobile Users**: Need visual feedback due to touch imprecision

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories

1. **As a land surveyor**, I want to see alignment guides when positioning parcels, so that I can maintain accurate boundary relationships.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - Guides appear within 50ms of alignment detection
     - Alignment accuracy within 0.01m
     - Works with rotated shapes

2. **As a site planner**, I want to see spacing measurements between buildings, so that I can maintain consistent setbacks.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - Shows exact distance in current units
     - Detects equal spacing patterns
     - Updates in real-time during drag

3. **As a mobile user**, I want shapes to snap to alignment positions, so that I can create precise layouts despite touch limitations.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - Snap threshold adapts to zoom level
     - Visual feedback before snapping
     - Can disable snapping if needed

### Secondary User Stories

4. **As a designer**, I want to distribute multiple shapes evenly, so that I can create professional layouts quickly.

5. **As a power user**, I want to create persistent guide lines, so that I can maintain consistent alignment across my project.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features

#### FR-001: Alignment Detection
- **Description**: Detect when shapes align during manipulation
- **Types**:
  - Edge alignment (left, right, top, bottom)
  - Center alignment (horizontal, vertical)
  - Equal spacing detection
- **Threshold**: 0.5m default, adjustable
- **Performance**: < 5ms for 50 shapes

#### FR-002: Visual Guide Rendering
- **Description**: Display dashed lines showing alignment
- **Appearance**:
  - Purple dashed lines (#8B5CF6)
  - 2px width, 5px dash/gap pattern
  - 80% opacity
  - Smooth fade in/out (200ms)
- **3D Integration**: Rendered on ground plane

#### FR-003: Spacing Indicators
- **Description**: Show distance measurements between shapes
- **Format**: Badge with distance (e.g., "66m")
- **Position**: Centered between shapes
- **Grouping**: Combine multiple equal spacings

#### FR-004: Smart Snapping
- **Description**: Automatically snap to alignment positions
- **Behavior**:
  - Engage within threshold
  - Priority: Edge > Center > Spacing
  - Smooth transition animation
  - Can be disabled

#### FR-005: Multi-Selection Distribution
- **Description**: Distribute multiple shapes with equal spacing
- **Options**:
  - Distribute horizontally
  - Distribute vertically
  - Align to edges/centers
- **Preview**: Show before applying

### Edge Cases

#### EC-001: Performance Degradation
- **Scenario**: User has 200+ shapes
- **Solution**: Limit detection to viewport, use spatial indexing

#### EC-002: Overlapping Guides
- **Scenario**: Multiple alignments at same position
- **Solution**: Merge guides, show strongest alignment

#### EC-003: Rotated Shape Alignment
- **Scenario**: Shapes at different angles
- **Solution**: Use bounding boxes for alignment

#### EC-004: Zoom Level Extremes
- **Scenario**: Very high or low zoom
- **Solution**: Adjust snap threshold dynamically

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- **NFR-001**: Guide detection < 5ms for typical scenes
- **NFR-002**: Maintain 60fps during drag operations
- **NFR-003**: Memory usage < 50MB additional

### Usability
- **NFR-004**: Guides visible but not obstructive
- **NFR-005**: Intuitive without documentation
- **NFR-006**: Consistent with design tool conventions

### Compatibility
- **NFR-007**: Works on all supported browsers
- **NFR-008**: Touch-optimized for mobile devices
- **NFR-009**: Accessible via keyboard navigation

## User Interface Requirements

### Visual Design
- **Color Scheme**: Purple (#8B5CF6) for guides
- **Typography**: Nunito Sans for measurements
- **Animation**: 200ms ease-in-out transitions
- **Contrast**: Visible on both grass and sky

### Layout Changes
- **Alignment Panel**: Add distribution controls
- **Settings**: Add snap configuration
- **Toolbar**: Optional guide lock button

### Mobile Considerations
- **Touch Zones**: Larger snap thresholds
- **Gestures**: Pinch to adjust threshold
- **Visibility**: Thicker guides on small screens

## Data Requirements

### New Data Structures
```typescript
interface AlignmentGuide {
  id: string;
  type: AlignmentType;
  position: Vector3;
  shapes: string[];
  strength: number;
}

interface SpacingMeasurement {
  distance: number;
  unit: string;
  position: Vector3;
  shapes: [string, string];
}
```

### Storage Requirements
- **Session Storage**: Active guides (cleared on refresh)
- **Local Storage**: User preferences (snap settings)
- **No Backend**: All calculations client-side

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- `DrawingCanvas.tsx` - Integration point for drag events
- `useAppStore.ts` - Shape position updates

### Phase 2: User Testing
- A/B test with subset of users
- Gather feedback on behavior
- Adjust thresholds based on usage

### Phase 3: Full Rollout
- Make default for all users
- Remove old alignment system
- Update documentation

## Success Metrics

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Performance Impact
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Impact**: High
- **Mitigation**: Spatial indexing, viewport culling

### Risk 2: Visual Clutter
- **Probability**: Low
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Fade guides quickly, limit simultaneous guides

### Risk 3: Mobile Complexity
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Adaptive thresholds, larger touch zones

## Open Questions

1. **AMBIGUITY**: Should guides work across different layers?
2. **AMBIGUITY**: How to handle alignment to locked shapes?
3. Should we show guides for shapes outside viewport?
4. What's the maximum number of simultaneous guides?
5. Should spacing indicators show in multiple units?
