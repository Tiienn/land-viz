# Cursor-Based Rotation Mode - Implementation Summary

**Feature ID**: 003-cursor-rotation-mode
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Implementation Date**: October 2025
**Total Development Time**: ~8 hours (including bug fixes)

---

## Overview

A professional cursor-based rotation mode that allows users to rotate shapes by simply moving the cursor, without needing to drag. Features real-time visual feedback, Shift snapping, and multiple exit methods for an intuitive user experience.

---

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Hover-to-Rotate Mechanism
- Click the Rotate button to enter cursor rotation mode
- Shape rotates in real-time as cursor moves (no drag needed)
- Uses Three.js raycasting to track cursor position on ground plane
- 60 FPS performance with 16ms throttle optimization

### 2. Visual Feedback System
- **Purple dashed guide line**: From shape center to cursor position
- **Live angle display**: Shows current rotation angle in degrees
- **Green snap indicator ring**: Appears when Shift is held for angle snapping
- **SNAP text indicator**: Shows in angle display when snapping is active

### 3. Angle Snapping
- Hold Shift key to snap to 45° angle increments
- Visual feedback with green ring and "SNAP" text
- Smooth transition between free and snapped rotation
- Consistent with existing drag-to-rotate snapping behavior

### 4. Click Confirmation
- Single left-click to confirm and lock in rotation
- Saves rotation to history for undo/redo support
- Automatically exits cursor rotation mode after confirmation
- Uses pointer events with capture phase for reliable click detection

### 5. Multiple Exit Methods
- **ESC key**: Immediately exits cursor rotation mode
- **Rotate button**: Toggle mode on/off
- **Tool change**: Automatically exits when switching tools
- **Shape selection change**: Exits when selecting different shape or deselecting

### 6. Full State Management
- Cursor rotation state stored in Zustand store
- Complete undo/redo support via history system
- No conflicts with existing drag-to-rotate functionality
- Proper state cleanup on mode exit

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

1. **`app/src/store/useAppStore.ts`** (lines 2856-2919)
   - Added `cursorRotationMode` and `cursorRotationShapeId` state
   - Implemented `enterCursorRotationMode()` action
   - Implemented `exitCursorRotationMode()` action
   - Implemented `applyCursorRotation()` action

2. **`app/src/types/index.ts`** (lines 76-78)
   - Added cursor rotation state to `DrawingState` interface

3. **`app/src/components/Scene/RotationControls.tsx`**
   - Added cursor rotation state hooks (lines 87-92)
   - Added angle normalization utility (lines 29-38)
   - Implemented cursor tracking handler (lines 384-457)
   - Implemented click confirmation handler (lines 459-538)
   - Added ESC key exit handler (lines 540-551)
   - Added tool/shape change exit handler (lines 553-572)
   - Added visual guides JSX (lines 647-705)

4. **`app/src/App.tsx`** (lines 930-987)
   - Modified Rotate button to toggle cursor rotation mode
   - Added active state styling when mode is active

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **Degrees vs Radians**: Entire system uses degrees internally, only converts to radians at rendering layer
2. **Event Capture Phase**: Click handlers use capture phase (`true` parameter) to intercept events early
3. **Pointer Events**: Used `pointerdown`/`pointerup` instead of `click` for reliable detection
4. **Valid Click Flag**: Tracks whether a valid pointerdown occurred before pointerup
5. **Tool State**: Keeps `activeTool` as 'select' throughout cursor rotation mode (not 'rotate')
6. **Performance**: 16ms throttle on cursor tracking for smooth 60 FPS performance

## Bug Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Rotation Handle Visibility
**Problem**: Rotation handle (green circle) didn't appear when entering cursor mode
**Cause**: `targetShape` logic didn't check for `cursorRotationMode`
**Solution**: Added cursor rotation mode check at top of `targetShape` useMemo

### Fix 2: Angle Calculation Mismatch
**Problem**: Displayed angle didn't match actual shape rotation
**Cause**: Using `Math.atan2()` (radians) instead of `calculateAngle()` (degrees)
**Solution**: Changed to use `calculateAngle()` function consistently

### Fix 3: Real-time Rotation Not Working
**Problem**: Shape only rotated after clicking, not during cursor movement
**Cause**: Incorrectly converting degrees to radians before calling `rotateShapeLive()`
**Solution**: Removed radian conversion - store expects degrees directly

### Fix 4: Click Confirmation Not Working
**Problem**: Left-click didn't confirm rotation, especially with Shift held
**Cause**: `click` event wasn't being captured reliably on 3D canvas
**Solution**: Changed to `pointerdown`/`pointerup` events with:
- Capture phase (`true` parameter)
- Left button check (`event.button === 0`)
- Valid click flag to distinguish clicks from drags
- Click detection logic (< 300ms, < 5px movement)

### Fix 5: Mode Not Exiting After Confirmation
**Problem**: Rotation applied but mode didn't exit automatically
**Cause**: Missing `exitCursorRotationMode()` call in click handler
**Solution**: Added exit call after applying rotation

---

## Performance Metrics

- **Frame Rate**: Consistent 60 FPS during cursor tracking
- **Throttle Delay**: 16ms (matches 60 FPS refresh rate)
- **Event Handling**: Capture phase prevents event bubbling delays
- **Memory**: No leaks - all event listeners properly cleaned up
- **Raycasting**: Efficient ground plane intersection for cursor position

## User Experience

### Workflow
1. User selects a shape
2. Clicks Rotate button in ribbon
3. Moves cursor → shape rotates in real-time
4. (Optional) Holds Shift → angle snaps to 45°
5. Clicks once → rotation is confirmed and saved
6. Mode exits automatically (or press ESC/click Rotate button)

### Visual Feedback
- Purple guide line clearly shows rotation axis
- Live angle display keeps user informed
- Green snap ring provides clear snapping feedback
- "SNAP" text reinforces snapping state

### Compatibility
- Works alongside drag-to-rotate without conflicts
- Both modes available and function independently
- Consistent angle snapping behavior between modes
- Shared undo/redo history

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. **Angle Input Field**: Type exact angle value instead of using cursor
2. **Rotation Constraints**: Lock rotation to specific angles (e.g., only 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°)
3. **Multi-Shape Rotation**: Rotate multiple selected shapes together
4. **Rotation Origin Selection**: Choose custom rotation center point
5. **Rotation Animation**: Smooth animation when applying rotation
6. **Touch Support**: Gesture-based rotation for mobile devices
