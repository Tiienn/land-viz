# Feature Specification: Visual Comparison Tool

**Spec ID**: 005
**Feature Name**: Visual Comparison Tool
**Created**: 2025-09-18
**Status**: Draft
**Priority**: High

## Overview

The Visual Comparison Tool enables users to understand land size by comparing their property to familiar reference objects. Users can visualize how many soccer fields, basketball courts, houses, or famous landmarks would fit on their land, making abstract measurements instantly comprehensible.

## Problem Statement

When users see "2000 m²" or "0.5 acres", they struggle to understand what that actually means in real-world terms. This feature bridges the gap between abstract numbers and tangible understanding by providing visual comparisons to objects everyone recognizes.

## User Stories

### Primary User Story
**As a** property buyer
**I want to** compare my land to familiar objects like soccer fields or houses
**So that** I can instantly understand the actual size and scale of the property

### Secondary User Stories
- **As a** real estate agent, I want to show clients relatable size comparisons to help them visualize property dimensions
- **As a** homeowner planning improvements, I want to see how many parking spaces or garden plots would fit in my yard
- **As a** developer, I want to demonstrate project scale using recognizable landmarks and buildings
- **As a** educator, I want to teach students about area and scale using familiar reference objects
