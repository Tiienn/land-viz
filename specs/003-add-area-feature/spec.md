# Feature Specification: Add Area Feature

**Spec ID**: 003
**Feature Name**: Add Area Feature
**Created**: 2025-09-17
**Status**: Draft
**Priority**: High

## Overview

A feature that allows users to specify a target area value (e.g., 3000 m²) and automatically generate a shape in the 3D scene that exactly matches that area. This enables reverse engineering of land parcels where the area is known but the shape needs to be created.

## User Stories

### Primary User Story
**As a** land surveyor/planner
**I want to** specify an exact area requirement and have a shape automatically generated
**So that** I can quickly create land parcels that meet specific area constraints

### Secondary User Stories
- **As a** property developer, I want to create multiple areas of different sizes to plan lot divisions
- **As a** user, I want to choose different shape types (square, rectangle, circle) for my area generation
- **As a** user, I want to specify areas in different units (m², sqft, acres, hectares) for flexibility

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: Area Input Interface
- **FR1.1**: Clicking "Add Area" in the toolbar opens a modal popup
- **FR1.2**: Modal contains input field for area value (numeric)
- **FR1.3**: Modal contains dropdown for units (m², sqft, acres, hectares, sqkm)
- **FR1.4**: Modal contains shape type selector (square, rectangle, circle)
- **FR1.5**: Modal contains "Create" and "Cancel" buttons
- **FR1.6**: Input validation prevents invalid/negative values

### FR2: Shape Generation
- **FR2.1**: System calculates appropriate dimensions for selected shape type
- **FR2.2**: Generated shape appears at scene center or last clicked position
- **FR2.3**: Shape is created on a new layer automatically
- **FR2.4**: Generated shape can be edited like any other shape (resize, rotate, move)
- **FR2.5**: Area calculations update in real-time during editing

### FR3: Layer Management
- **FR3.1**: New layer is created with name "Area: [value] [unit]"
- **FR3.2**: Layer appears in layer panel with generated area shape
- **FR3.3**: Layer can be renamed, hidden, or deleted like other layers
- **FR3.4**: Multiple area shapes can be created on separate layers

### FR4: Unit Conversion
- **FR4.1**: System supports conversion between all area units
- **FR4.2**: Display shows both input units and metric equivalents
- **FR4.3**: Calculations maintain precision for professional use

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Performance
- **NFR1.1**: Modal opens within 100ms
- **NFR1.2**: Shape generation completes within 200ms
- **NFR1.3**: No impact on existing 3D scene performance

### NFR2: Usability
- **NFR2.1**: Follows Canva-inspired design system
- **NFR2.2**: Clear visual feedback during shape creation
- **NFR2.3**: Intuitive error messages for invalid inputs
- **NFR2.4**: Keyboard shortcuts (Enter to create, Esc to cancel)

### NFR3: Accuracy
- **NFR3.1**: Area calculations accurate to 4 decimal places
- **NFR3.2**: Unit conversions use standard conversion factors
- **NFR3.3**: Generated shapes maintain exact area when created

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Modal Interaction
- [ ] "Add Area" button opens modal popup
- [ ] Modal displays all required input fields
- [ ] Modal can be closed with Cancel button or Esc key
- [ ] Invalid inputs show clear error messages

### AC2: Area Generation
- [ ] Entering "3000" with "m²" and "square" creates a square with 3000 m² area
- [ ] Generated shape appears in 3D scene at appropriate location
- [ ] Shape is fully editable after creation
- [ ] Area calculations show exact input value

### AC3: Layer Creation
- [ ] New layer created automatically with descriptive name
- [ ] Layer appears in layer panel
- [ ] Multiple areas can be created on separate layers
- [ ] Layer management functions work properly

### AC4: Unit Support
- [ ] All units (m², sqft, acres, hectares, sqkm) work correctly
- [ ] Unit conversion displays are accurate
- [ ] Different shape types calculate dimensions correctly

## Edge Cases

### EC1: Input Validation
- **AMBIGUITY**: What's the minimum/maximum area allowed?
- Empty input field
- Negative values
- Non-numeric input
- Extremely large values that might cause rendering issues

### EC2: Shape Positioning
- **AMBIGUITY**: Where exactly should the shape appear? Scene center or mouse position?
- Overlapping with existing shapes
- Shape extends beyond visible scene bounds
- Multiple rapid area creation

### EC3: Shape Types
- **AMBIGUITY**: For rectangles, what aspect ratio should be used by default?
- Circle vs polygon approximation for circles
- Very small areas that might not be visible
- Very large areas that exceed scene boundaries

## UI/UX Requirements

### Modal Design
- **Size**: 400px width, auto height
- **Position**: Center of screen
- **Style**: Matches existing Canva-inspired design
- **Animation**: Smooth fade-in (200ms)
- **Backdrop**: Semi-transparent overlay

### Input Fields
- **Area Input**: Number field with validation
- **Units Dropdown**: Select with common units
- **Shape Selector**: Radio buttons or dropdown
- **Buttons**: Primary "Create" and secondary "Cancel"

### Visual Feedback
- **Loading State**: Show spinner during generation
- **Success State**: Brief confirmation message
- **Error State**: Clear error styling and messages

## Integration Points

### Existing Systems
- **Toolbar**: Integrate "Add Area" button
- **Layer System**: Create and manage new layers
- **Shape System**: Generate shapes using existing shape types
- **Area Calculations**: Use existing area calculation utilities
- **3D Scene**: Render generated shapes in scene

### State Management
- **Drawing State**: Manage modal open/close state
- **Shape State**: Add generated shapes to shapes array
- **Layer State**: Create and manage new layers

## Success Metrics

- **Usability**: Users can create area shapes in under 30 seconds
- **Accuracy**: Generated areas match input within 0.01% tolerance
- **Adoption**: Feature used for at least 20% of new shape creation
- **Performance**: No measurable impact on scene rendering performance

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Area Calculation Complexity**: Ensuring exact area generation for different shapes
- **Unit Conversion Accuracy**: Maintaining precision across all unit types

### Medium Risk
- **UI Integration**: Seamless integration with existing toolbar
- **Performance Impact**: Additional shapes and layers affecting scene performance

### Low Risk
- **Modal Implementation**: Standard UI pattern with existing design system
- **Layer Management**: Building on existing layer infrastructure

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- Existing area calculation utilities (`areaCalculations.ts`)
- Shape creation system (`useAppStore.ts`)
- Layer management system
- Modal/popup component infrastructure

### Design Dependencies
- Canva-inspired design system
- Existing button and input styling patterns
- Icon for "Add Area" button

## Future Considerations

- **Batch Area Creation**: Create multiple areas at once
- **Area Templates**: Save common area/shape combinations
- **Smart Positioning**: Auto-arrange multiple areas to minimize overlap
- **Import/Export**: Import area requirements from spreadsheets
- **Area Constraints**: Create shapes that fit within existing boundaries
