# Feature Specification: Insert Area Feature

**Feature Name:** Insert Area with Shape Generation
**Date:** January 2025
**Status:** Ready for Implementation

## User Story

As a Land Visualizer user, I want to click "Insert Area" and specify a required area in my preferred units so that the system automatically generates a shape with that exact area in the 3D scene, allowing me to quickly create property boundaries of known size.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] "Insert Area" button is accessible in the main toolbar ribbon
- [ ] Clicking "Insert Area" opens a modal popup dialog
- [ ] Popup allows user to enter numerical area value
- [ ] Popup provides unit selection dropdown (m², ft², acres, hectares, sq km)
- [ ] System validates input (positive numbers, reasonable ranges)
- [ ] User can cancel or confirm the area insertion
- [ ] Upon confirmation, a rectangle shape is generated with the exact specified area
- [ ] Generated shape appears in the center of the current 3D viewport
- [ ] Generated shape is automatically selected for immediate editing
- [ ] Generated shape follows current grid snapping settings
- [ ] User can immediately resize, rotate, or edit the generated shape
- [ ] Generated shape appears in the layers panel
- [ ] System shows success feedback when shape is created

## Functional Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. **Area Input Interface**
   - Modal dialog with clean, professional styling
   - Numerical input field with validation
   - Unit selector dropdown with common area units
   - Clear "Cancel" and "Create Shape" buttons
   - Real-time input validation with error messages

2. **Shape Generation**
   - Default to rectangular shape for simplicity
   - Calculate dimensions to achieve exact area (square aspect ratio preferred)
   - Position shape at center of current viewport
   - Apply current grid snapping if enabled
   - Automatically select the new shape

3. **Integration**
   - Add to existing tool ribbon in logical position
   - Follow existing UI patterns and styling
   - Integrate with current shape management system
   - Work with existing layer system

### Input Validation
- **Area Range**: 1 m² to 1,000,000 m² (reasonable property sizes)
- **Input Format**: Positive decimal numbers only
- **Unit Conversion**: Automatic conversion between units
- **Error Messages**: Clear feedback for invalid inputs

### Unit Support
- **Square Meters (m²)** - Primary/default unit
- **Square Feet (ft²)** - Common imperial unit
- **Acres** - Property measurement standard
- **Hectares** - Metric property measurement
- **Square Kilometers (sq km)** - Large area measurement

## UI/UX Requirements

### Visual Design
- **Modal Dialog**: Centered overlay with backdrop blur
- **Modern Styling**: Consistent with Canva-inspired design system
- **Button Placement**: In main toolbar ribbon, near drawing tools
- **Icon Design**: Area/measurement themed icon
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop and tablet viewports

### User Experience Flow
1. User clicks "Insert Area" button in toolbar
2. Modal opens with focus on area input field
3. User enters desired area (e.g., "3000")
4. User selects unit from dropdown (e.g., "m²")
5. User clicks "Create Shape" or presses Enter
6. Modal closes, rectangle appears in 3D scene
7. New shape is selected and ready for editing
8. User can immediately modify the generated shape

### Accessibility
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab through form elements
- **Enter Key**: Submits the form
- **Escape Key**: Closes modal
- **Screen Reader**: Proper labels and descriptions
- **Focus Management**: Returns focus to trigger button after closing

## Technical Constraints

### Performance
- **Modal Rendering**: Lightweight, fast opening/closing
- **Shape Generation**: Instantaneous calculation and rendering
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal impact on existing performance

### Browser Compatibility
- **Modern Browsers**: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+
- **Mobile Support**: Touch-friendly on tablets
- **3D Rendering**: Must work with existing Three.js setup

## Edge Cases

### Input Edge Cases
- **Empty Input**: Show validation error
- **Zero/Negative**: Show "must be positive" error
- **Very Large Areas**: Warn if shape would be too big for viewport
- **Very Small Areas**: Warn if shape would be barely visible
- **Invalid Characters**: Filter non-numeric input
- **Decimal Precision**: Support up to 2 decimal places

### Shape Generation Edge Cases
- **Viewport Boundaries**: Ensure shape fits in visible area
- **Existing Shapes**: Avoid overlapping with selected shapes
- **Grid Snapping**: Respect current snapping settings
- **Zoom Level**: Consider current camera distance for appropriate sizing

### System Edge Cases
- **No Space**: Handle when viewport is full of shapes
- **Memory Limits**: Graceful handling of many shapes
- **Unit Conversion Errors**: Robust conversion with fallbacks

## Success Metrics

### User Experience
- **Modal Opens**: < 100ms from button click
- **Shape Generation**: < 200ms from form submission
- **User Adoption**: Track "Insert Area" button usage
- **Error Rates**: < 5% of attempts result in errors

### Technical Performance
- **Memory Impact**: < 50KB additional memory usage
- **Rendering Impact**: No measurable frame rate reduction
- **Bundle Size**: < 20KB additional bundle size

## Dependencies

### Existing Components
- **useAppStore**: Shape management and tool state
- **ShapeRenderer**: Display generated shapes
- **App.tsx**: Toolbar button placement
- **DrawingCanvas**: Integration with drawing system

### New Components Required
- **InsertAreaDialog**: Modal popup component
- **InsertAreaButton**: Toolbar button component
- **AreaInputField**: Validated input component
- **UnitSelector**: Dropdown for unit selection

## Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Shape Overlap**: Generate in empty areas or offset slightly
- **Unit Conversion Bugs**: Comprehensive test coverage for conversions
- **Modal Z-Index Issues**: Use established modal patterns
- **State Management**: Ensure proper integration with existing store

### UX Risks
- **Confusing Interface**: Follow established design patterns
- **Unexpected Shape Size**: Preview dimensions before creation
- **Tool Context**: Clear indication of what will happen

## Ambiguities

**AMBIGUITY:** Should the feature support shape types other than rectangles?
- **Current Decision**: Start with rectangles only for MVP
- **Future Consideration**: Could add circle, square, or custom shape options

**AMBIGUITY:** How should very large areas be handled when they exceed viewport?
- **Current Decision**: Show warning and allow user to proceed or cancel
- **Alternative**: Auto-zoom out to fit the shape

**AMBIGUITY:** Should there be a preview of the shape before creation?
- **Current Decision**: Direct creation for simplicity
- **Future Enhancement**: Live preview option

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Features
- **Shape Type Selection**: Rectangle, square, circle options
- **Custom Dimensions**: Specify width/height instead of just area
- **Shape Templates**: Common property sizes (residential lots, etc.)
- **Batch Creation**: Create multiple shapes with different areas

### Advanced Features
- **Import from File**: Load areas from CSV/Excel
- **Area Constraints**: Maximum/minimum area limits
- **Smart Positioning**: Avoid existing shapes automatically
- **Undo/Redo**: Full support for area insertion operations

## Conclusion

The Insert Area feature provides a direct way for users to create shapes of known areas, streamlining the workflow for property boundary creation and land planning tasks. This specification ensures the feature integrates seamlessly with the existing Land Visualizer architecture while maintaining the high-quality user experience standards established in the current application.
