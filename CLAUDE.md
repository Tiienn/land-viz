# Land Visualizer - Current Implementation Status

> **Note**: See `docs/project/CLAUDE.md` for comprehensive project documentation, roadmap, and Chili3D integration plans.

## Current Implementation (Phase 1 Complete)
A professional 3D land visualization tool with CAD-style interface, successfully implemented with:

- ‚úÖ **Modern UI**: Ribbon toolbar with drawing tools, status displays
- ‚úÖ **3D Scene**: Full Three.js/React Three Fiber implementation  
- ‚úÖ **Interactive Drawing**: Polygon, rectangle, circle, polyline tools
- ‚úÖ **Professional Controls**: Custom mouse mapping (right-orbit, middle-pan)
- ‚úÖ **Visual Design**: Natural color scheme (green grass ground, blue sky)
- ‚úÖ **Performance**: 60 FPS with infinite grid coverage

## Quick Start
```bash
cd app
npm run dev     # Development server (http://localhost:5173)
```

## Implementation Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **3D Engine**: Three.js + React Three Fiber + Drei
- **State**: Zustand store for drawing state
- **Styling**: Inline styles (avoids CSS compilation issues)

## Architecture Overview

### Main Components
- `App.tsx` - Main application with ribbon toolbar and 3D scene container
- `SceneManager.tsx` - 3D scene setup with lighting and canvas configuration
- `CameraController.tsx` - Professional orbital controls (left-click disabled, middle pan, right orbit)
- `GridBackground.tsx` - Infinite green grass grid with custom canvas texture
- `DrawingCanvas.tsx` - Interactive 3D drawing with raycasting
- `ShapeRenderer.tsx` - Renders drawn shapes in 3D space

### State Management
- `useAppStore.ts` - Zustand store for drawing state and shapes
- Drawing tools: select, rectangle, polyline, circle, polygon
- Real-time synchronization between UI and 3D scene

## Recent Major Changes
1. **Complete UI Redesign**: Replaced complex component architecture with inline-styled ribbon interface
2. **3D Implementation**: Full Three.js integration with professional controls
3. **Visual Enhancement**: Natural color scheme with green ground and blue sky
4. **Performance Optimization**: Custom grid rendering for infinite viewport coverage

## Known Issues & Solutions
- **CSS Compilation**: Use inline styles exclusively to avoid build issues
- **Hot Reload**: Kill all node processes if changes don't reflect: `taskkill /f /im node.exe`
- **Multiple Servers**: Only run one dev server at a time to avoid port conflicts

## Controls Reference
- **Right-click + Drag**: Orbit camera around scene
- **Middle-click + Drag**: Pan view
- **Mouse Wheel**: Zoom in/out (fast zoom speed: 2.0x)
- **Left-click**: Drawing mode (when tool selected) or selection

## Next Development Areas
- Advanced measurement tools and annotations
- Export functionality (Excel, DXF, etc.)
- Layer management system
- Property boundary import/export
- Terrain elevation tools

## üöÄ For the Next Developer

### What's Currently Working (Phase 1 Complete)
The foundation is solid! You have a fully functional 3D land visualization tool with:
- Professional ribbon UI that matches the reference design
- Complete 3D scene with natural grass ground and blue sky
- All drawing tools working (polygon, rectangle, circle, polyline)
- Custom camera controls (right-click orbit, middle-click pan)
- Real-time shape rendering and area calculations

### Immediate Next Steps (Recommended Priority)
1. **Fix the Drawing Tools** - They're visually complete but need functionality:
   - `DrawingCanvas.tsx:` Currently handles clicks but drawing logic needs completion
   - `ShapeRenderer.tsx:` Renders shapes but needs proper measurements display
   - Test each tool: rectangle, circle, polygon, polyline

2. **Add Measurement Display** - Users need to see actual numbers:
   - Add area calculations for completed shapes
   - Display perimeter measurements
   - Show real-time measurements while drawing

3. **Implement Export Functionality** - The Excel Export button is ready:
   - Create export service to generate Excel files with measurements
   - Include shape coordinates and calculated areas

### Critical Implementation Notes
‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: This project uses inline styles exclusively to avoid CSS compilation issues. DO NOT import any CSS files or use className props - continue with the inline style pattern.

üîß **Development Environment**:
- Always run `cd app && npm run dev` (not from root)
- Server usually runs on port 5173
- If changes don't reflect: kill all node processes with `taskkill /f /im node.exe`
- Hard refresh browser if needed

üéØ **Architecture Pattern**:
- State management: Zustand store (`useAppStore.ts`)
- 3D Scene: Three.js + React Three Fiber
- UI Components: Direct inline styling
- No CSS compilation - everything is styled inline

### Quick Wins for Next PR
1. **Complete Rectangle Drawing** (1-2 hours):
   ```typescript
   // In DrawingCanvas.tsx, add rectangle completion logic
   if (tool === 'rectangle' && points.length === 2) {
     // Create rectangle from two corner points
     completeShape();
   }
   ```

2. **Add Area Display** (2-3 hours):
   - Show area in the bottom status overlay
   - Use existing calculation utilities
   - Display in multiple units (m¬≤, ft¬≤, acres)

3. **Test All Drawing Tools** (1 hour):
   - Click through each tool to verify functionality
   - Fix any broken interactions

### Files You'll Mainly Work With
- `app/src/components/Scene/DrawingCanvas.tsx` - Drawing interaction logic
- `app/src/components/Scene/ShapeRenderer.tsx` - Shape visualization
- `app/src/store/useAppStore.ts` - State management
- `app/src/App.tsx` - Main UI (only if adding new ribbon buttons)

### Gotchas to Avoid
- Don't create new CSS files - use inline styles only
- Don't change camera controls - users specifically requested current setup
- Don't modify the green grass / blue sky color scheme
- Test on both desktop and mobile (responsive design is working)

### Ready to Continue?
1. Pull latest changes
2. Run `cd app && npm run dev`
3. Open http://localhost:5173
4. Start with fixing rectangle drawing tool
5. Focus on user-visible functionality over architectural changes

The foundation is excellent - just needs the drawing interactions completed! üéØ
