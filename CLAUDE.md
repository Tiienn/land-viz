## Visual Development & Testing

### Design System

The project follows S-Tier SaaS design standards inspired by Stripe, Airbnb, and Linear. All UI development must adhere to:

- **Design Principles**: `/context/design-principles.md` - Comprehensive checklist for world-class UI
- **Component Library**: NextUI with custom Tailwind configuration

### Quick Visual Check

**IMMEDIATELY after implementing any front-end change:**

1. **Identify what changed** - Review the modified components/pages
2. **Navigate to affected pages** - Use `mcp__playwright__browser_navigate` to visit each changed view
3. **Verify design compliance** - Compare against `/context/design-principles.md`
4. **Validate feature implementation** - Ensure the change fulfills the user's specific request
5. **Check acceptance criteria** - Review any provided context files or requirements
6. **Capture evidence** - Take full page screenshot at desktop viewport (1440px) of each changed view
7. **Check for errors** - Run `mcp__playwright__browser_console_messages` ⚠️

This verification ensures changes meet design standards and user requirements.

### Comprehensive Design Review

For significant UI changes or before merging PRs, use the design review agent:

```bash
# Option 1: Use the slash command
/design-review

# Option 2: Invoke the agent directly
@agent-design-review
```

The design review agent will:

- Test all interactive states and user flows
- Verify responsiveness (desktop/tablet/mobile)
- Check accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- Validate visual polish and consistency
- Test edge cases and error states
- Provide categorized feedback (Blockers/High/Medium/Nitpicks)

### Playwright MCP Integration

#### Essential Commands for UI Testing

```javascript
// Navigation & Screenshots
mcp__playwright__browser_navigate(url); // Navigate to page
mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot(); // Capture visual evidence
mcp__playwright__browser_resize(
  width,
  height
); // Test responsiveness

// Interaction Testing
mcp__playwright__browser_click(element); // Test clicks
mcp__playwright__browser_type(
  element,
  text
); // Test input
mcp__playwright__browser_hover(element); // Test hover states

// Validation
mcp__playwright__browser_console_messages(); // Check for errors
mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot(); // Accessibility check
mcp__playwright__browser_wait_for(
  text / element
); // Ensure loading
```

### Design Compliance Checklist

When implementing UI features, verify:

- [ ] **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear focus flow, appropriate spacing
- [ ] **Consistency**: Uses design tokens, follows patterns
- [ ] **Responsiveness**: Works on mobile (375px), tablet (768px), desktop (1440px)
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigable, proper contrast, semantic HTML
- [ ] **Performance**: Fast load times, smooth animations (150-300ms)
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Clear error states, helpful messages
- [ ] **Polish**: Micro-interactions, loading states, empty states

## When to Use Automated Visual Testing

### Use Quick Visual Check for:

- Every front-end change, no matter how small
- After implementing new components or features
- When modifying existing UI elements
- After fixing visual bugs
- Before committing UI changes

### Use Comprehensive Design Review for:

- Major feature implementations
- Before creating pull requests with UI changes
- When refactoring component architecture
- After significant design system updates
- When accessibility compliance is critical

### Skip Visual Testing for:

- Backend-only changes (API, database)
- Configuration file updates
- Documentation changes
- Test file modifications
- Non-visual utility functions

## Additional Context

- Design review agent configuration: `/.claude/agents/design-review-agent.md`
- Design principles checklist: `/context/design-principles.md`
- Custom slash commands: `/context/design-review-slash-command.md`

### What's Currently Working (Phase 1 Complete)
The foundation is solid! You have a fully functional 3D land visualization tool with:
- Professional ribbon UI that matches the reference design
- Complete 3D scene with natural grass ground and blue sky
- All drawing tools working (rectangle, circle, polyline)
- **Complete shape editing system** with draggable sphere corners
- **Professional rotation system** with contextual handles and angle snapping
- **Edit mode toggle** - Enter/Exit Edit mode for selected shapes
- **Corner manipulation** - Add/delete corners with visual feedback
- Custom camera controls (right-click orbit, middle-click pan)

- Enhanced polyline drawing with imaginary line and smart closing
- Proper area calculations for all shape types
- Properties panel with tool instructions and grid controls
- Crosshair cursor in drawing modes
- **Modern Typography** - Nunito Sans font system for enhanced readability

### Immediate Next Steps (Recommended Priority)
1. **Export Functionality** - The Excel Export button is ready:
   - Create export service to generate Excel files with measurements
   - Include shape coordinates and calculated areas
   - Support multiple export formats (Excel, CSV, DXF)

2. **Layer Management** - Organize shapes into layers:
   - Add layer creation and management UI
   - Layer visibility toggle
   - Layer-based shape organization

3. **Advanced Measurement Tools**:
   - Distance measurement tool
   - Angle measurement tool
   - Elevation and terrain tools

### Critical Implementation Notes
⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: This project uses inline styles exclusively to avoid CSS compilation issues. DO NOT import any CSS files or use className props - continue with the inline style pattern.

🔧 **Development Environment**:
- Always run `cd app && npm run dev` (not from root)
- Server usually runs on port 5173
- If changes don't reflect: kill all node processes with `taskkill /f /im node.exe`
- Hard refresh browser if needed

🎯 **Architecture Pattern**:
- State management: Zustand store (`useAppStore.ts`)
- 3D Scene: Three.js + React Three Fiber
- UI Components: Direct inline styling
- No CSS compilation - everything is styled inline

### Quick Wins for Next PR
1. **Excel Export Implementation** (2-3 hours):
   - Create export service to generate Excel files
   - Include shape data: coordinates, areas, perimeters
   - Add export button functionality

2. **Mobile Responsiveness** (1-2 hours):
   - Test touch interactions on mobile devices
   - Optimize UI for smaller screens
   - Ensure drawing tools work on touch

3. **Performance Optimization** (1 hour):
   - Optimize shape rendering for large numbers of shapes
   - Add shape batching or culling for better performance

### Files You'll Mainly Work With
- `app/src/components/Scene/DrawingCanvas.tsx` - Drawing interaction logic
- `app/src/components/Scene/ShapeRenderer.tsx` - Shape visualization with rotation transforms
- `app/src/components/Scene/RotationControls.tsx` - Rotation handle and interaction logic
- `app/src/store/useAppStore.ts` - State management with rotation metadata
- `app/src/App.tsx` - Main UI (only if adding new ribbon buttons)

### Gotchas to Avoid
- Don't create new CSS files - use inline styles only
- Don't change camera controls - users specifically requested current setup
- Don't modify the green grass / blue sky color scheme
- Test on both desktop and mobile (responsive design is working)

### Ready to Continue?
1. Pull latest changes
2. Run `cd app && npm run dev`
3. Open http://localhost:5173 (or 5174 if port is in use)
4. All drawing tools are working - focus on export functionality
5. Continue building advanced features on this solid foundation

The core functionality is complete and working perfectly! 🎯
