- **Professional Tools, Modern Look**: CAD precision with contemporary styling

> **Note**: All technical capabilities remain unchanged. The visual refresh focuses solely on making the interface more modern and approachable while maintaining professional functionality.

## Quick Start
```bash
cd app
npm run dev     # Development server (http://localhost:5173)
```

## Implementation Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **3D Engine**: Three.js + React Three Fiber + Drei
- **State**: Zustand store for drawing state
- **Styling**: Inline styles (avoids CSS compilation issues)

## Architecture Overview

### Main Components
- `App.tsx` - Main application with ribbon toolbar and 3D scene container
- `SceneManager.tsx` - 3D scene setup with lighting and canvas configuration
- `CameraController.tsx` - Professional orbital controls (left-click disabled, middle pan, right orbit)
- `GridBackground.tsx` - Infinite green grass grid with custom canvas texture
- `DrawingCanvas.tsx` - Interactive 3D drawing with raycasting
- `ShapeRenderer.tsx` - Renders drawn shapes in 3D space

### State Management
- `useAppStore.ts` - Zustand store for drawing state and shapes
- Drawing tools: select, rectangle, polyline, circle
- Real-time synchronization between UI and 3D scene

## Recent Major Changes
1. **Complete UI Redesign**: Replaced complex component architecture with inline-styled ribbon interface
2. **3D Implementation**: Full Three.js integration with professional controls
3. **Visual Enhancement**: Natural color scheme with green ground and blue sky
4. **Performance Optimization**: Custom grid rendering for infinite viewport coverage
5. **Drawing Tools Enhancement**: Fixed area calculations, added polyline imaginary line, crosshair cursors
6. **UI Improvements**: Moved coordinates to bottom-left, enhanced dimension scaling, Properties panel
7. **Canva-Inspired Visual Refresh**: Modern UI styling with clean SVG icons, smooth animations, professional typography
8. **Expandable Panels**: Added collapsible/expandable left and right sidebars with smooth animations
9. **Professional Ribbon Toolbar**: Clean tool grouping with visual separators and consistent styling
10. **Logo Integration**: Replaced emoji with professional Land-Visualizer512.png logo
11. **Removed Terrain Elevation**: Streamlined toolbar by removing unused terrain section
12. **Layer Panel Enhancement**: Full modal dialogs for color selection and layer ordering

## Known Issues & Solutions
- **CSS Compilation**: Use inline styles exclusively to avoid build issues
- **Hot Reload**: Kill all node processes if changes don't reflect: `taskkill /f /im node.exe`
- **Multiple Servers**: Only run one dev server at a time to avoid port conflicts

## Controls Reference
- **Right-click + Drag**: Orbit camera around scene
- **Middle-click + Drag**: Pan view
- **Mouse Wheel**: Zoom in/out (fast zoom speed: 2.0x)
- **Left-click**: Drawing mode (when tool selected) or selection

## üöÄ For the Next Developer

### What's Currently Working (Phase 1 Complete)
The foundation is solid! You have a fully functional 3D land visualization tool with:
- Professional ribbon UI that matches the reference design
- Complete 3D scene with natural grass ground and blue sky
- All drawing tools working (rectangle, circle, polyline)
- Custom camera controls (right-click orbit, middle-click pan)
- Real-time shape rendering and area calculations
- Enhanced polyline drawing with imaginary line and smart closing
- Proper area calculations for all shape types
- Properties panel with tool instructions and grid controls
- Crosshair cursor in drawing modes

### Immediate Next Steps (Recommended Priority)
1. **Export Functionality** - The Excel Export button is ready:
   - Create export service to generate Excel files with measurements
   - Include shape coordinates and calculated areas
   - Support multiple export formats (Excel, CSV, DXF)

2. **Layer Management** - Organize shapes into layers:
   - Add layer creation and management UI
   - Layer visibility toggle
   - Layer-based shape organization

3. **Advanced Measurement Tools**:
   - Distance measurement tool
   - Angle measurement tool
   - Elevation and terrain tools

### Critical Implementation Notes
‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: This project uses inline styles exclusively to avoid CSS compilation issues. DO NOT import any CSS files or use className props - continue with the inline style pattern.

üîß **Development Environment**:
- Always run `cd app && npm run dev` (not from root)
- Server usually runs on port 5173
- If changes don't reflect: kill all node processes with `taskkill /f /im node.exe`
- Hard refresh browser if needed

üéØ **Architecture Pattern**:
- State management: Zustand store (`useAppStore.ts`)
- 3D Scene: Three.js + React Three Fiber
- UI Components: Direct inline styling
- No CSS compilation - everything is styled inline

### Quick Wins for Next PR
1. **Excel Export Implementation** (2-3 hours):
   - Create export service to generate Excel files
   - Include shape data: coordinates, areas, perimeters
   - Add export button functionality

2. **Mobile Responsiveness** (1-2 hours):
   - Test touch interactions on mobile devices
   - Optimize UI for smaller screens
   - Ensure drawing tools work on touch

3. **Performance Optimization** (1 hour):
   - Optimize shape rendering for large numbers of shapes
   - Add shape batching or culling for better performance

### Files You'll Mainly Work With
- `app/src/components/Scene/DrawingCanvas.tsx` - Drawing interaction logic
- `app/src/components/Scene/ShapeRenderer.tsx` - Shape visualization
- `app/src/store/useAppStore.ts` - State management
- `app/src/App.tsx` - Main UI (only if adding new ribbon buttons)

### Gotchas to Avoid
- Don't create new CSS files - use inline styles only
- Don't change camera controls - users specifically requested current setup
- Don't modify the green grass / blue sky color scheme
- Test on both desktop and mobile (responsive design is working)

### Ready to Continue?
1. Pull latest changes
2. Run `cd app && npm run dev`
3. Open http://localhost:5173 (or 5174 if port is in use)
4. All drawing tools are working - focus on export functionality
5. Continue building advanced features on this solid foundation

The core functionality is complete and working perfectly! üéØ
