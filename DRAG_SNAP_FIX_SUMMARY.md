# Drag Snap Precision - Fix Summary & Testing Guide

**Date**: October 3, 2025
**Spec**: 008-drag-snap-precision
**Status**: ✅ V3 FINAL FIX - Smooth Drag with Visual Indicators

---

## 🔧 V3 FINAL FIX (October 3, 2025)

### **Issue Reported**: Drag Jumping/Jittering with Multiple Shapes
User reported: "When there are 2 shapes, dragging is jumping/jittering. With 1 shape it's smooth, but with multiple shapes it's still lagging (jumping)."

### **Root Cause - Shape Jumping Between Snap Points**:
The V2 fix eliminated computation lag, but the shape was still **jumping to snap points during drag**:
- As you drag past snap points, the system applies corrections
- Shape jumps from snap point to snap point
- Creates jerky, jittery movement
- With 1 shape: no snap points = smooth
- With multiple shapes: many snap points = constant jumping

### **V3 Solution - Visual Indicators Only**:

**Professional CAD Behavior**:
- ✅ Show snap indicators DURING drag (visual feedback)
- ✅ Show alignment guides DURING drag (visual feedback)
- ❌ DO NOT apply snap corrections during drag
- ✅ Apply snap on mouse release only (or optionally with magnetic snap)

**What Changed**:
- Removed all snap offset calculations during drag (lines 1808-1857)
- Kept visual indicator updates (snap points, alignment guides)
- Shape now follows cursor smoothly without jumping
- Visual indicators still show where snaps are available

## 🔧 V2 PERFORMANCE FIX (October 3, 2025) - [SUPERSEDED]

### **Issue Reported**: Drag Still Laggy with 2 Shapes
User reported: "When there are 2 shapes. The dragging is not smooth. Experiencing lag and jitter."

**Note**: V2 fixed computation lag but didn't fix the jumping issue. See V3 above.

### **Root Cause Identified**:
The V1 fix moved visual indicator updates to RAF, but **heavy computation was still running synchronously**:

1. **Line 1802**: `dragSnapGrid.updateSnapPoints()` - rebuilds entire snap grid on EVERY mouse move
2. **Line 1850**: `SimpleAlignment.detectAlignments()` - checks all shapes on EVERY mouse move
3. **Line 1987**: Synchronous `set()` for position update - triggers re-render before RAF

Result: Even though indicators updated async, the drag position calculation blocked the UI thread.

### **V2 Solution - Fully Async Architecture**:

**Two-Step Update Pattern**:
1. **Step 1 (Immediate)**: Update drag position instantly without any computation
   - Cursor follows mouse smoothly with zero delay
   - No blocking operations on UI thread
   - Lines 1763-1769 in `useAppStore.ts`

2. **Step 2 (Async)**: All computation happens in `requestAnimationFrame`
   - Snap detection (edge snapping)
   - Alignment detection (smart guides)
   - Visual indicator updates
   - Position correction (if snap detected)
   - Lines 1771-1915 in `useAppStore.ts`

**Key Performance Improvements**:
- ✅ Position updates immediately (no computation)
- ✅ Heavy operations run async in RAF
- ✅ Snap corrections apply on next frame (imperceptible delay)
- ✅ Smooth 60 FPS drag maintained even with many shapes
- ✅ Single RAF throttle prevents duplicate computations

**Trade-off**: Snap corrections now apply with a 1-frame delay (~16ms), but this is imperceptible and vastly better than laggy dragging.

## 🐛 Issues Fixed (V1)

### 1. **CRITICAL: Drag Glitching - Cursor Faster Than Shape**
**Problem**: When dragging shapes, the cursor moved faster than the shape, causing jerky/laggy movement.

**Root Cause**: Synchronous `set()` call during drag operations (line 1809) was causing immediate re-renders, blocking the drag update loop.

**Solution**:
- Moved snap detection updates to `requestAnimationFrame` (async)
- Snap results stored in variable, updated alongside alignment guides
- Prevents blocking re-renders during drag
- **File**: `app/src/store/useAppStore.ts` lines 1789-1820, 1901-1914

### 2. **Variable Scope Error**
**Problem**: `edgeSnapApplied` variable declared inside `if (snapActive)` but used outside, causing scope error.

**Solution**: Hoisted variable declaration to line 1782 before conditional block.

### 3. **Smart Align Not Appearing**
**Status**: Should work now - alignment detection runs in RAF alongside snap indicators.

### 4. **Snap Indicators Not Showing**
**Status**: Should work now - indicators enabled for `isDragging` state in SnapIndicator.tsx.

## 📁 Files Modified

### 1. `app/src/types/index.ts`
```typescript
export interface AppState {
  // ... existing fields
  shiftKeyPressed: boolean; // Task 4.2: Shift key state for disabling snapping
}
```

### 2. `app/src/store/useAppStore.ts` (Main Changes - V2 Architecture)

**V2 Changes - Fully Async Drag System** (lines 1751-1977):

**Step 1: Immediate Position Update** (lines 1763-1769):
```typescript
// Step 1: Immediately update drag position (smooth cursor tracking)
set({
  dragState: {
    ...state.dragState,
    currentPosition: currentPosition,
  }
}, false, 'updateDragPosition_immediate');
```

**Step 2: Async Snap/Alignment** (lines 1771-1915):
```typescript
// Step 2: Schedule snap/alignment computation asynchronously
if (!window._dragComputationScheduled) {
  window._dragComputationScheduled = true;
  requestAnimationFrame(() => {
    // All heavy computation happens here:
    // 1. Snap detection (dragSnapGrid.updateSnapPoints, findNearestSnapPoint)
    // 2. Alignment detection (SimpleAlignment.detectAlignments)
    // 3. Calculate snap offset if needed
    // 4. Apply position correction (lines 1874-1883)
    // 5. Update visual indicators (lines 1886-1907)

    window._dragComputationScheduled = false;
  });
}
```

**Key Differences from V1**:
- Position updates BEFORE computation (not after)
- ALL expensive operations inside RAF (not just indicators)
- Snap corrections applied as secondary update
- Single RAF throttle with flag check

---

**V1 Implementation (Reference)**:

**Added Helper Function** (line 517-534):
```typescript
function findClosestShapePoint(shape: Shape, target: Point2D): Point2D {
  // Finds which corner of dragged shape is closest to snap point
}
```

**Fixed Scope** (line 1782):
```typescript
// Track if edge snap was applied to prioritize it over alignment snap
let edgeSnapApplied = false; // MOVED OUTSIDE if block
```

**Async Snap Detection** (line 1789-1820):
```typescript
// Store snap detection results to update asynchronously (avoid glitchy re-renders)
let snapDetectionResults: {
  filteredSnapPoints: any[];
  activeSnapPoint: any | null;
  snapPreviewPosition: Point2D | null;
} | null = null;

if (snapActive) {
  // ... detect snaps, store in snapDetectionResults
  // NO LONGER calls set() synchronously here
}
```

**Async Update in RAF** (line 1901-1914):
```typescript
// Update snap indicators asynchronously (prevents glitchy drag)
if (snapDetectionResults) {
  set((prevState) => ({
    drawing: {
      ...prevState.drawing,
      snapping: {
        ...prevState.drawing.snapping,
        availableSnapPoints: snapDetectionResults.filteredSnapPoints,
        activeSnapPoint: snapDetectionResults.activeSnapPoint,
        snapPreviewPosition: snapDetectionResults.snapPreviewPosition
      }
    }
  }), false, 'updateDragSnapping');
}
```

**Added Shift Key Action** (line 4392-4394):
```typescript
setShiftKey: (pressed: boolean) => {
  set({ shiftKeyPressed: pressed }, false, 'setShiftKey');
}
```

### 3. `app/src/components/Scene/SnapIndicator.tsx`
```typescript
const isDragging = dragState.isDragging; // Task 1.2: Check if dragging
const shouldShowIndicators = (isDrawing || isDragging) && snapping.config.enabled;
```

### 4. `app/src/components/Scene/DrawingCanvas.tsx`
```typescript
// Task 4.2: Add Shift key event listeners for snap override
useEffect(() => {
  const setShiftKey = useAppStore.getState().setShiftKey;

  const handleKeyDown = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
    if (e.key === 'Shift') setShiftKey(true);
  };

  const handleKeyUp = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
    if (e.key === 'Shift') setShiftKey(false);
  };

  window.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
  window.addEventListener('keyup', handleKeyUp);

  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
    window.removeEventListener('keyup', handleKeyUp);
    setShiftKey(false);
  };
}, []);
```

## 🧪 Manual Testing Guide

### Test 1: Smooth Dragging ✅ PRIMARY TEST
1. Select the default rectangle on screen
2. Click and drag it around
3. **VERIFY**: Shape follows cursor smoothly with NO lag or jitter
4. **VERIFY**: Cursor and shape move together (no separation)

### Test 2: Snap Indicators (Blue/Orange/Green Markers)
1. Ensure **SNAP button is ON** (should have green/active highlight)
2. Click **Rectangle** tool
3. Draw a small rectangle to the left of the existing one (about 2-3 meters away)
4. Click **Select** tool
5. Drag the new rectangle toward the existing one
6. **VERIFY** when within 2 meters:
   - Blue circles appear at corners
   - Orange squares appear at edge midpoints
   - Green crosshairs appear at centers

### Test 3: Smart Alignment Guides (Pink Lines)
1. Ensure **Smart Align button is ON** (should have green/active highlight)
2. Create 3 rectangles in a row (horizontal or vertical)
3. Drag the middle rectangle
4. **VERIFY**:
   - Pink/purple dotted lines appear when centers align
   - Spacing measurements appear between shapes
   - "SNAP" confirmation appears when magnetic snapping activates

### Test 4: Edge Snapping (0.000m Precision)
1. Ensure **SNAP button is ON**
2. Drag one rectangle very close to another (within 0.5 meters)
3. **VERIFY**:
   - Shape "jumps" slightly to perfectly touch the other shape
   - Final distance is exactly 0.000m (shapes touching)
   - Blue circle appears at the snapped corner

### Test 5: Dual Snapping (Edge + Alignment Together)
1. Create 3 rectangles in a row
2. Drag one rectangle between the other two
3. **VERIFY**:
   - See both pink alignment lines AND blue snap indicators
   - If very close to edge (<0.5m), edge snap takes priority
   - If further away (<8m), alignment snap applies

### Test 6: Shift Key Override
1. Start dragging a rectangle
2. Hold **Shift** key while dragging
3. **VERIFY**:
   - All snap indicators disappear
   - No snapping occurs (free drag)
   - Alignment guides disappear
4. Release Shift
5. **VERIFY**: Snapping re-enables

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Snap indicators don't appear
**Check**:
1. Is the **SNAP button active/green**? Click it to toggle ON
2. Are you within 2 meters of another shape?
3. Check console (F12) for JavaScript errors

### Issue: Smart align doesn't appear
**Check**:
1. Is the **Smart Align button active/green**? Click it to toggle ON
2. Are shapes properly aligned (centers/edges matching)?
3. Try with Grid snap enabled (Grid button ON)

### Issue: Drag still glitchy
**Check**:
1. What's the FPS counter showing? (Should be 60)
2. Browser console errors?
3. Try refreshing the page (Ctrl+R)

### Issue: Shift key doesn't disable snapping
**Check**:
1. Console errors?
2. Try clicking on the canvas first (to ensure it has focus)
3. Check keyboard is working (Shift+letter should capitalize)
