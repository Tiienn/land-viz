## [Unreleased]

### Added

#### Direct Dimension Input Feature (2025-01-10)
- **Rectangle Dimension Input**: Enter exact sizes before creating rectangles
  - Width × Height format (e.g., "10x15", "10 x 15", "33ft x 50ft")
  - Auto-activation when typing numbers (no button click needed)
  - Real-time validation with error messages
  - Supports meters (m), feet (ft), and yards (yd)
  - Click to place rectangle with exact dimensions

- **Circle Dimension Input**: Precision circle creation with radius/diameter modes
  - Radius mode: Direct radius input (e.g., "10", "r10", "5m")
  - Diameter mode: Diameter input auto-converts to radius (e.g., "d20")
  - Unit selection dropdown (m, ft, yd)
  - r/d toggle for switching between radius and diameter modes
  - Auto-focus input field when typing numbers
  - Real-time conversion and validation

- **Enhanced Toolbar UI**: Professional dimension input interface
  - Canva-inspired styling with smooth transitions
  - Fixed positioning beside Tools & Functions ribbon
  - Clear visual feedback for active/inactive states
  - Error messages with helpful validation hints
  - Clear button to reset input quickly

- **Integration Features**: Seamless connection with existing drawing workflow
  - Works with grid snapping for precise placement
  - Compatible with alignment guides and magnetic snapping
  - Proper unit conversion to meters for internal storage
  - Dimension calculations use original points (not rotated/transformed)

### Changed

#### Grouping System Production Cleanup (2025-01-07)
- **Console Log Removal**: Removed all debug console logs from grouping system
  - Cleaned `GroupBoundary.tsx` (removed 4 debug logs)
  - Cleaned `GroupBoundaryManager.tsx` (removed 3 debug logs)
  - Updated `GroupBoundary.test.tsx` (8 tests now verify rendering instead of console output)
  - Result: Silent production code without debug clutter
  - All 21 GroupBoundary tests still passing
  - Zero functionality changes
  - Professional user experience with clean console output
  - Performance monitoring logic preserved (internal calculations only)

### Fixed

#### Circle Dimension Calculation Bug (2025-01-10)
- **Issue**: Incorrect radius and area displayed when using dimension input
  - D=10m showed r=1.0m, area=3 m² (expected: r=5.0m, area=78.54 m²)
  - r=10m showed r=1.6m, area=8 m² (expected: r=10.0m, area=314.16 m²)
  - Affected both 2D and 3D view modes

- **Root Cause**: ShapeDimensions component receiving rotated/transformed points
  - Visual rendering applies rotation transforms for display
  - Dimension calculations were using transformed points instead of original stored points
  - Rotation transforms should only affect visual mesh, not measurements

- **Solution**: Pass original shape data to ShapeDimensions (ShapeRenderer.tsx:1002)
  - Changed from: `shape={{...shape, points: transformedPoints}}`
  - Changed to: `shape={shape}`
  - Ensures dimension calculations always use untransformed points
  - Maintains separation between visual transforms and data calculations

- **Documentation**: Complete debugging process and prevention guidelines in `CIRCLE_DIMENSION_BUG_FIX.md`

### Added

#### Direct Distance Entry Line Tool with Multi-Line Mode (2025-09-26)
- **AutoCAD-Style Precision Line Drawing**: Professional CAD workflow with exact distance input
  - Single line mode: Click first point → enter distance → creates precise line in cursor direction
  - Multi-line mode: Tab to enable → polyline-style workflow with distance entry at each segment
  - Mathematical precision using direction vectors and distance calculations
  - Real-time preview with cursor tracking and grid snapping integration

- **Multi-Segment Polyline Creation**: Advanced polyline workflow with distance control
  - Automatic shape closing when clicking near start point (4m threshold)
  - Manual completion with Space key for open polylines
  - Segment counter and progress tracking during multi-line creation
  - Connected line chains with precise distance control at each segment

- **Enhanced Distance Input Interface**: Professional input modal with keyboard shortcuts
  - Fixed positioning beside mouse position indicator (no overlap)
  - Dynamic instruction text based on current mode (single vs multi-line)
  - Keyboard shortcuts: Tab (enable multi-line), Space (complete), ESC (cancel)
  - Auto-focus and text selection for efficient distance entry

- **Integration Features**: Seamless connection with existing drawing systems
  - Works with existing grid snapping (1m snap increments)
  - Compatible with alignment guides and magnetic snapping
  - Lines excluded from total area calculations (lines don't have area)
  - Proper shape naming: "Line N" for single lines, "Multi-Line N" for polylines
