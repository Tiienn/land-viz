## 🎯 What is Land Visualizer?

Land Visualizer is an intuitive web application that helps anyone understand property sizes by converting confusing measurements like "2000m²" into clear, relatable visual comparisons. No CAD knowledge required - just draw your land and instantly see how many soccer fields, parking spaces, or houses fit inside.

### 🎨 Modern Visual Design

The application features a **Canva-inspired modern UI** with professional CAD functionality:
- Clean, contemporary interface with vibrant teal/purple color scheme
- Smooth animations and micro-interactions
- Gradient buttons with elegant hover effects
- Professional tools wrapped in an approachable, friendly design

### ✨ Key Features

- **🎨 Smart Drawing** - Click to draw property boundaries with automatic shape completion
- **📏 Instant Calculations** - Real-time area, perimeter, and dimension measurements
- **🔧 Expandable Panels** - Collapsible/expandable left and right sidebars with smooth animations
- **🎛️ Professional Ribbon** - Clean tool grouping with SVG icons and visual separators
- **🔄 Unit Conversion** - Seamlessly switch between m², ft², acres, and hectares
- **⚡ Visual Comparisons** - See your land compared to familiar objects
- **🎯 Precision Mode** - Professional-grade accuracy powered by Chili3D
- **📱 Mobile First** - Works perfectly on phones, tablets, and desktops
- **🚀 Fast & Lightweight** - Loads in under 3 seconds on 3G

## 🎮 Usage

### Basic Drawing
1. Select a drawing tool: **Rectangle**, **Circle**, or **Polyline**
2. Click on the 3D canvas to start drawing
3. For rectangles: Click two diagonal corners
4. For circles: Click center, then click radius point  
5. For polylines: Click multiple points, then click near start to close
6. Crosshair cursor shows exact drawing position
7. Real-time dimensions display during drawing

### Viewing Measurements
1. Green area labels show total area for closed shapes
2. Dimension labels show lengths for each side
3. Circle shapes display radius measurement
4. Polylines show area if 3+ points (treated as closed shape)
5. All measurements scale appropriately with camera zoom

### Precision Mode
1. Toggle **Pro Mode** in settings
2. Enables survey-grade accuracy (±0.01%)
3. Unlocks CAD export options

## 🧪 Testing

# Run all tests
npm test

# Unit tests only
npm run test:unit

# Integration tests
npm run test:integration

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```
