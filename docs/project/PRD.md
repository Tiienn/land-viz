# Product Requirements Document
## Land Visualizer - Visual Land Size Calculator & Planner

**Version**: 2.0  
**Date**: August 26, 2025  
**Status**: In Development - MVP Phase  
**Target Launch**: November 30, 2025

---

## Executive Summary

Land Visualizer is a web application that helps people understand property sizes by converting abstract measurements into clear visual representations. Users can input land dimensions, draw custom shapes, and compare their property to familiar reference objects like soccer fields or parking spaces.

**Key Value**: Transform "2000m²" from a meaningless number into an instant visual understanding.

---

## Problem Statement

### Customer Problem
Property buyers and homeowners cannot visualize what land measurements actually mean. When viewing real estate listings or planning property improvements, they struggle to understand the actual size and potential of the space.

### Current Solutions Are Inadequate
- **CAD Software**: Too complex, expensive, requires training
- **Google Earth**: Not designed for property visualization
- **Paper/Calculators**: No visual component
- **Real Estate Photos**: Don't convey true scale

### Our Solution
A simple web tool that instantly shows land size through interactive 3D visualization and familiar comparisons, requiring zero technical knowledge.
