# Text Tool Improvements - January 13, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Text Box Not Visible in 2D Mode ✅
**Problem**: Inline text editor not appearing when clicking in 2D mode

**Root Causes**:
- Coordinate system mismatch (fixed in previous commit)
- Missing `distanceFactor` prop on Html component
- Text box too small to be visible from 2D camera distance

**Solutions**:
- ✅ Added `distanceFactor={10}` to InlineTextEditor.tsx (line 141)
- ✅ Added `distanceFactor={10}` to TextObject.tsx (line 57)
- ✅ Increased text box size by 2x

### 2. ESC Key Not Creating Text ✅
**Problem**: Pressing ESC after typing text did nothing - no text object appeared

**Root Cause**:
- Empty text was being deleted on ESC
- Logic didn't properly save text with content

**Solution**:
- ✅ Modified `finishInlineEdit()` in useTextStore.ts (lines 146-207)
- Now checks if content is empty:
  - Empty content → Delete text object
  - Has content → Save text object
- ✅ Added comprehensive console logging for debugging

### 3. Text Box Too Small (2x Size Increase) ✅
**Problem**: Text editor was too small to be easily visible and usable

**Solutions** (InlineTextEditor.tsx lines 106-129):
- ✅ Font size: `16px` → `32px` (2x)
- ✅ Padding: `8px 12px` → `16px 24px` (2x)
- ✅ Min width: `200px` → `400px` (2x)
- ✅ Min height: `40px` → `80px` (2x)
- ✅ Max width: `400px` → `800px` (2x)

## Files Modified

### 1. InlineTextEditor.tsx
**Changes**:
- Line 108: Font size doubled (`initialFontSize * 2`)
- Line 114: Padding doubled (`16px 24px`)
- Lines 118-120: Size doubled (min/max width/height)
- Line 72-74: ESC now always calls `onFinish()` (simplified logic)
- Line 141: Added `distanceFactor={10}` for visibility
- Added debug logging (lines 72, 78)

### 2. TextObject.tsx
**Changes**:
- Line 57: Added `distanceFactor={10}` for consistent visibility

### 3. useTextStore.ts
**Changes**:
- Lines 146-207: Completely refactored `finishInlineEdit()`:
  - Added comprehensive logging
  - Check for empty content and delete if empty
  - Only update text if it has content
  - Better error handling
  - Clear state management

### 4. DrawingCanvas.tsx
**Changes**:
- Lines 686, 696, 701: Added debug logging for text creation flow

## Technical Details

### Distance Factor Explanation

The `distanceFactor` prop in drei's `<Html>` component controls how the HTML element scales relative to camera distance:

```typescript
// Without distanceFactor (default = 1)
<Html position={[x, y, z]} />
// Element appears tiny from far away

// With distanceFactor = 10
<Html position={[x, y, z]} distanceFactor={10} />
// Element scales 10x larger, visible from camera distance
```

In 2D mode, the camera is ~100 units away from the ground. Without a distance factor, the default scale makes HTML elements virtually invisible.

### Empty Content Handling

The improved logic in `finishInlineEdit()`:

```typescript
const trimmedContent = draftTextContent.trim();

if (trimmedContent === '') {
  // Delete empty text objects
  get().deleteText(inlineEditingTextId);
  // Clear state and return
  return;
}

// Only reach here if content exists
get().updateText(inlineEditingTextId, {
  content: trimmedContent
});
```

This prevents empty text objects from cluttering the scene and ensures only meaningful text is saved.

## Testing Checklist

### 2D Mode Tests
- [x] Click Text button in 2D mode
- [x] Click canvas
- [x] ✅ Text editor appears (now visible with distanceFactor)
- [x] Type "Test 2D"
- [x] Press ESC
- [x] ✅ Text object appears in scene
- [x] Text readable and properly sized

### 3D Mode Tests
- [x] Click Text button in 3D mode
- [x] Click canvas
- [x] ✅ Text editor appears
- [x] Type "Test 3D"
- [x] Press ESC
- [x] ✅ Text object appears in scene
- [x] Text readable and properly sized

### Empty Text Tests
- [x] Click Text button
- [x] Click canvas
- [x] Editor appears
- [x] Don't type anything
- [x] Press ESC
- [x] ✅ No text object created (empty deleted)

### Size Tests
- [x] Text editor 2x bigger than before ✅
- [x] Easier to read ✅
- [x] Easier to click/focus ✅
- [x] Still fits on screen ✅

## Console Logging

Debug logs added for troubleshooting:

```
[DrawingCanvas] Creating text at position: {x, y, z}
[DrawingCanvas] Adding text to store: {...}
[DrawingCanvas] Starting inline edit
[InlineTextEditor] ESC pressed, content: "..."
[useTextStore] finishInlineEdit called {...}
[useTextStore] Text exists: true Content: "..."
```

These can be removed once confirmed stable in production.

## Known Limitations

1. **Font Size**: Text objects render at 32px now (doubled from 16px)
   - This matches the editor size
   - May need adjustment based on user feedback

2. **Distance Factor**: Fixed at 10 for all text
   - Works well for normal camera distances
   - Extreme zoom may need dynamic scaling

3. **Coordinate Mapping**: Still assumes Y-up coordinate system
   - Works correctly for current setup
   - Document if coordinate system changes

## Future Improvements

### Phase 1 (Completed)
- ✅ Fix 2D mode visibility
- ✅ Fix ESC key behavior
- ✅ Increase text box size

### Phase 2 (Future)
- [ ] Dynamic font size based on camera distance
- [ ] Text outline/stroke for better visibility
- [ ] Background color options
- [ ] Multi-line text support improvements

### Phase 3 (Future)
- [ ] Text editing on double-click
- [ ] Drag to move text
- [ ] Resize handles for text
- [ ] Font selection in editor

## Performance Impact

All changes are performance-neutral or positive:
- ✅ No additional renders
- ✅ No memory leaks
- ✅ Logging can be removed for production
- ✅ Distance factor has no performance cost

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Start dev server
cd app && npm run dev

# Open browser
http://localhost:5173

# Test 2D mode
Press V → Click Text → Click canvas → Type → ESC

# Test 3D mode
Press V → Click Text → Click canvas → Type → ESC

# Check console for logs
F12 → Console tab → Look for [DrawingCanvas], [InlineTextEditor], [useTextStore]
```

## Success Criteria

- [x] Text editor visible in 2D mode
- [x] Text editor visible in 3D mode
- [x] ESC creates text when content exists
- [x] ESC deletes text when content empty
- [x] Text box 2x bigger and more readable
- [x] No console errors
- [x] Proper logging for debugging

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

1. **Revert distanceFactor**: Remove `distanceFactor={10}` from both files
2. **Revert size changes**: Change multiplier back to 1x in InlineTextEditor
3. **Revert logic changes**: Restore original finishInlineEdit logic

All changes are isolated and can be reverted independently.
