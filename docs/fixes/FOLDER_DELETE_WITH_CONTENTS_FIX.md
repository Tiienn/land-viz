# Bug Fix: Folder Delete with Contents - Shapes Still Visible

## Date
October 18, 2025

## Issue

**Reported Bug**: When deleting a folder with "Delete folder and all contents" option, the shapes and text remain visible on the canvas even though the folder and layers are removed from the Layer Panel.

**Severity**: High - Data appears to be deleted but is still rendered, causing confusion and potential data integrity issues.

---

## Root Cause

The `deleteFolder()` function with `deleteChildren: true` was only removing:
- ✅ Layers (folders and child layers)
- ✅ Selected layer IDs
- ❌ **Missing**: Shapes belonging to deleted layers
- ❌ **Missing**: Elements belonging to deleted layers
- ❌ **Missing**: Selected shape/element IDs

**Why This Happened**: The app uses:
1. `shapes` array - Legacy shape storage
2. `elements` array - Unified storage for both ShapeElement and TextElement

When deleting a folder, we were only cleaning up the `layers` array, leaving orphaned shapes and elements that continued to render on the canvas.

---

## Solution

Updated the `deleteFolder()` function to also delete:
- ✅ Shapes from the `shapes` array
- ✅ Elements from the `elements` array
- ✅ Selected shape ID if it belonged to a deleted layer
- ✅ Selected element IDs that belonged to deleted layers

---

## Technical Details

### File Modified
`app/src/store/useAppStore.ts` (lines 861-918)

### Code Changes

**BEFORE (Incomplete Cleanup)**:
```typescript
deleteFolder: (folderId: string, deleteChildren: boolean = false) => {
  if (deleteChildren) {
    const toDelete = [folderId, ...getFolderDescendants(folderId)];

    set(state => ({
      layers: state.layers.filter(l => !toDelete.includes(l.id)),
      selectedLayerIds: state.selectedLayerIds.filter(id => !toDelete.includes(id)),
      activeLayerId: toDelete.includes(state.activeLayerId) ? '' : state.activeLayerId
      // ❌ Missing: shapes cleanup
      // ❌ Missing: elements cleanup
      // ❌ Missing: selectedShapeId cleanup
      // ❌ Missing: selectedElementIds cleanup
    }));
  }
}
```

**AFTER (Complete Cleanup)**:
```typescript
deleteFolder: (folderId: string, deleteChildren: boolean = false) => {
  if (deleteChildren) {
    const toDelete = [folderId, ...getFolderDescendants(folderId)];

    set(state => ({
      layers: state.layers.filter(l => !toDelete.includes(l.id)),
      // Phase 3: Delete all shapes and elements that belong to deleted layers
      shapes: state.shapes.filter(shape => !toDelete.includes(shape.layerId)), // ✅ Added
      elements: state.elements.filter(element => !toDelete.includes(element.layerId)), // ✅ Added
      selectedLayerIds: state.selectedLayerIds.filter(id => !toDelete.includes(id)),
      selectedShapeId: state.shapes.some(shape => shape.id === state.selectedShapeId && toDelete.includes(shape.layerId))
        ? null : state.selectedShapeId, // ✅ Added
      selectedElementIds: state.selectedElementIds.filter(elementId => {
        const element = state.elements.find(el => el.id === elementId);
        return element ? !toDelete.includes(element.layerId) : true;
      }), // ✅ Added
      activeLayerId: toDelete.includes(state.activeLayerId) ? '' : state.activeLayerId
    }));
  }
}
```

### What Gets Deleted Now

When using "Delete folder and all contents":

1. **Folder itself** - Removed from layers
2. **All descendant folders** - Recursively found and removed
3. **All child layers** - Direct and nested layers removed
4. **All shapes** - From legacy shapes array
5. **All elements** - From unified elements array (ShapeElement + TextElement)
6. **Selected shape ID** - Cleared if it was in a deleted layer
7. **Selected element IDs** - Filtered to remove deleted items
8. **Active layer ID** - Reset if active layer was deleted

---

## Recursive Deletion Logic

The function uses recursive descent to find all descendants:

```typescript
const getFolderDescendants = (id: string): string[] => {
  const children = layers.filter(l => l.parentId === id);
  const descendants = children.map(c => c.id);
  children
    .filter(c => c.type === 'folder')
    .forEach(c => descendants.push(...getFolderDescendants(c.id)));
  return descendants;
};
```

**Example Hierarchy**:
```
Folder 1
├── Layer A (has shapes)
├── Folder 2
│   ├── Layer B (has shapes)
│   └── Folder 3
│       └── Layer C (has text)
└── Layer D (has shapes)
```

**Deleting Folder 1 with contents removes**:
- Folder 1, Folder 2, Folder 3 (all folders)
- Layer A, Layer B, Layer C, Layer D (all layers)
- All shapes in layers A, B, D
- All text in layer C
- All elements (shapes + text) in all layers

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Simple Folder with Shapes

**Setup**:
```javascript
const store = window.__useAppStore.getState();
store.createFolder('Test Folder');
// Draw shapes in Layer Panel
// Move shapes to Test Folder
```

**Steps**:
1. Create a folder
2. Add layers with shapes to the folder
3. Click delete on folder
4. Choose "Delete folder and all contents"

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Folder disappears from Layer Panel
- ✅ All layers inside disappear from Layer Panel
- ✅ **All shapes disappear from canvas** (this was broken before)
- ✅ No orphaned shapes
- ✅ Selection cleared if deleted items were selected

---

### Test Case 2: Nested Folders with Multiple Layers

**Setup**:
```javascript
const store = window.__useAppStore.getState();
store.createFolder('Parent');
store.createFolder('Child');
// Nest Child inside Parent
// Add multiple layers with shapes to both
```

**Steps**:
1. Create nested folder structure
2. Add layers with shapes to each folder
3. Delete parent folder with "Delete all contents"

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Parent folder deleted
- ✅ Child folder deleted (recursive)
- ✅ All layers deleted
- ✅ All shapes from all layers deleted from canvas
- ✅ No visual artifacts remain

---

### Test Case 3: Mixed Content (Shapes + Text)

**Setup**:
1. Create folder
2. Add layers with both shapes and text
3. Delete folder with all contents

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Shapes disappear from canvas
- ✅ Text disappears from canvas
- ✅ Elements array cleaned up
- ✅ No memory leaks

---

## Console Testing

```javascript
// Create test folder with content
const store = window.__useAppStore.getState();
store.createFolder('Test Delete');

// Draw some shapes (they'll be in active layer)
// Move active layer into Test Delete folder

// Check before deletion
console.log('Before deletion:');
console.log('Layers:', store.layers.length);
console.log('Elements:', store.elements.length);
console.log('Shapes:', store.shapes.length);

// Get folder ID
const folderId = store.layers.find(l => l.name === 'Test Delete').id;

// Delete folder and all contents
store.deleteFolder(folderId, true);

// Check after deletion
console.log('After deletion:');
console.log('Layers:', store.layers.length);
console.log('Elements:', store.elements.length); // Should decrease
console.log('Shapes:', store.shapes.length);     // Should decrease

// Verify no orphaned elements
const orphans = store.elements.filter(el => {
  return !store.layers.some(l => l.id === el.layerId);
});
console.log('Orphaned elements (should be 0):', orphans.length);
```

**Expected Console Output**:
```
Before deletion:
Layers: 3
Elements: 8
Shapes: 8

After deletion:
Layers: 2
Elements: 3
Shapes: 3

Orphaned elements (should be 0): 0
```

## Edge Cases Handled

1. ✅ **Empty folder** - Deletes cleanly with no errors
2. ✅ **Deeply nested folders** - Recursive deletion works to any depth
3. ✅ **Mixed content types** - Handles both shapes and text elements
4. ✅ **Selected items** - Clears selection if deleted items were selected
5. ✅ **Active layer** - Resets active layer if it was deleted
6. ✅ **Folder with only folders** - Deletes nested folder structure
7. ✅ **Folder with only layers** - Deletes all child layers and their content

---

## Related Bugs Fixed

This fix is related to the earlier bug fix for regular layer deletion:

**October 18, 2025 - Layer Deletion Bug**: Fixed `deleteLayer()` to also delete elements, not just shapes.

**Pattern**: Both bugs had the same root cause - incomplete cleanup of the unified `elements` array when deleting layers.

**Comprehensive Fix**: Now both `deleteLayer()` and `deleteFolder()` properly clean up:
- shapes array (legacy)
- elements array (unified)
- selectedShapeId
- selectedElementIds

---

## Performance Impact

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n = number of layers + number of elements
- **Expected Duration**: <10ms for typical folder deletion (1 folder, 5 layers, 20 elements)
- **Memory Impact**: Immediate garbage collection of deleted objects
- **No Performance Degradation**: Filtering operations are efficient
