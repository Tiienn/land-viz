# Text Tool 2D Mode - Final Fixes

**Date**: January 2025
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Text Size and Vertical Orientation in 2D Mode
**Problem**:
- Text appeared too large in 2D mode
- Text was rendering vertically instead of horizontally

**Root Cause**:
- `distanceFactor={3}` made text too large for orthographic cameras
- `transform: rotate(${text.rotation}deg) scale(1.5)` was rotating text and making it oversized
- Missing horizontal text enforcement

**Solution Applied**:
```typescript
// app/src/components/Text/TextObject.tsx:68-73
distanceFactor={8}  // Changed from 3 to 8 (higher = smaller for orthographic)
style={{
  transform: 'scale(0.8)',  // Removed rotation, reduced scale from 1.5 to 0.8
  pointerEvents: text.locked ? 'none' : 'auto',
  whiteSpace: 'nowrap'  // Prevent wrapping
}}

// Line 99: Force horizontal text
style={{
  ...textStyle,
  writingMode: 'horizontal-tb' as const
}}
```

**Result**:
- Text is now ~40% smaller (distanceFactor 3→8 + scale 1.5→0.8)
- Text renders horizontally and is readable
- No unwanted rotation applied

### Issue 2: Properties Panel Not Showing Text Controls
**Problem**:
- Text had blue selection border but Properties Panel showed "Select Tool" instructions
- Text selection state was not persisting

**Root Cause**:
- Timing issue: DrawingCanvas click handler fired before or during TextObject click
- Coordination flag was checked before being set
- React event batching caused race condition

**Solution Applied**:

**1. Enhanced Event Handling** (TextObject.tsx:76-95):
```typescript
onClick={(e) => {
  e.stopPropagation();
  e.preventDefault();  // NEW: Prevent default to reduce interference

  // Set flag FIRST, synchronously
  if ((window as any).__textClickedRef) {
    (window as any).__textClickedRef.current = true;
  }

  onClick?.();
}}

onPointerDown={(e) => {
  // NEW: Also set flag on pointer down as backup
  // Ensures flag is set before any click handlers
  e.stopPropagation();
  if ((window as any).__textClickedRef) {
    (window as any).__textClickedRef.current = true;
  }
}}
```

**2. Delayed Flag Reset** (DrawingCanvas.tsx:398-400):
```typescript
if (textClickedRef.current) {
  // Reset flag using setTimeout (was immediate before)
  setTimeout(() => {
    textClickedRef.current = false;
  }, 0);
  return;
}
```

**Result**:
- Properties Panel now correctly shows text editing controls when text is selected
- Text selection persists through React event batching
- No more immediate deselection

## Technical Summary

### Size Calculation
```
Before: distanceFactor=3, scale=1.5
After:  distanceFactor=8, scale=0.8

Size reduction:
- distanceFactor: 8/3 = 2.67x smaller
- Scale: 0.8/1.5 = 0.53x smaller
- Total: ~2.67 × 0.53 = ~1.4x smaller (30-40% size reduction)
```

### Event Flow (Fixed)
```
1. User clicks text
2. onPointerDown fires → Sets flag ✅
3. onClick fires → Reinforces flag, calls selectText() ✅
4. DrawingCanvas mesh click → Checks flag (now set) → Returns early ✅
5. Next event loop tick → Flag reset via setTimeout
6. Properties Panel → Receives selectedTextId → Shows text controls ✅
```

## Files Modified

1. **TextObject.tsx** (`app/src/components/Text/TextObject.tsx`)
   - Line 68: `distanceFactor={8}` (was 3)
   - Line 70: `transform: 'scale(0.8)'` (was `rotate(${text.rotation}deg) scale(1.5)`)
   - Line 72: Added `whiteSpace: 'nowrap'`
   - Line 77: Added `e.preventDefault()`
   - Lines 88-95: Added `onPointerDown` handler
   - Line 99: Added `writingMode: 'horizontal-tb'`

2. **DrawingCanvas.tsx** (`app/src/components/Scene/DrawingCanvas.tsx`)
   - Lines 398-400: Changed to `setTimeout(() => textClickedRef.current = false, 0)`

## Testing Results

### 2D Mode Text
- ✅ Text renders horizontally (readable orientation)
- ✅ Text size is appropriate (not oversized)
- ✅ Text is clearly visible and readable
- ✅ No vertical orientation issues

### Properties Panel
- ✅ Click text → Properties Panel shows text editing controls
- ✅ Text controls include: font size, color, alignment, etc.
- ✅ No "Select Tool" instructions when text is selected
- ✅ Selection persists correctly

## Key Learnings

1. **Orthographic vs Perspective**:
   - Higher distanceFactor values make text SMALLER in orthographic mode
   - Opposite behavior from perspective cameras

2. **Text Rotation in 2D**:
   - Don't apply rotation transforms in 2D orthographic view
   - Let text always render horizontally for readability

3. **Event Timing**:
   - Use `onPointerDown` + `onClick` for critical timing
   - Use `setTimeout(..., 0)` to preserve state through React batching
   - Add `e.preventDefault()` to reduce event interference

4. **Coordination Pattern**:
   - Set flags as early as possible (onPointerDown)
   - Reset flags as late as possible (setTimeout)
   - This ensures flags persist through entire event cycle

## Before vs After

**Before**:
- Text: Too large, vertical, hard to read
- Properties: Showed Select Tool instead of text controls
- Selection: Immediately cleared after being set

**After**:
- Text: Appropriate size, horizontal, clearly readable
- Properties: Shows text editing controls correctly
- Selection: Persists and displays properly
