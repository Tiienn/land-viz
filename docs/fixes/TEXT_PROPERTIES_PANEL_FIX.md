# Text Properties Panel Fix

**Date:** January 12, 2025
**Issue:** Properties Panel not showing when text is selected
**Status:** âœ… RESOLVED

## Problem Description

When users clicked on existing text objects in the Land Visualizer, the Properties Panel on the right side did not display text editing options. Instead, it continued showing tool instructions and grid settings.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation Findings

1. **Text Selection Working Correctly**
   - `TextObject.tsx` has proper `onClick` handler
   - `TextRenderer.tsx` correctly passes `onClick={() => selectText(text.id)}`
   - `selectedTextId` was being set in the text store
   - `TextPropertiesPanel` component exists and works properly

2. **UI Rendering Issue**
   - The conditional rendering logic in `PropertiesPanel.tsx` was **correct** but **ineffective**
   - `TextPropertiesPanel` was rendered alongside tool instructions
   - Tool instructions took up most of the space, pushing text properties down
   - Users couldn't see text properties without scrolling

3. **Missing Deselection Logic**
   - Clicking on empty space with select tool didn't deselect text
   - Only shape selection was cleared, text remained selected
   - Created confusion when switching between shapes and text

## Solution Implemented

### Fix 1: Priority View for Text Properties

**File:** `app/src/components/PropertiesPanel.tsx`

Changed the rendering logic to show text properties as a **priority view** when text is selected, hiding all other content:

```typescript
// BEFORE (lines 186-273)
{selectedTextId && (
  <TextPropertiesPanel onEditClick={handleTextEditClick} />
)}

{/* Current Tool Section */}
<div style={{ /* tool instructions */ }}>
  {/* Grid Settings, Coordinate Display, etc. */}
</div>

// AFTER (lines 186-425)
{selectedTextId ? (
  <TextPropertiesPanel onEditClick={handleTextEditClick} />
) : (
  <>
    {/* Current Tool Section - only shown when no text is selected */}
    <div style={{ /* tool instructions */ }}>
      {/* Grid Settings, Coordinate Display, etc. */}
    </div>
  </>
)}
```

**Why This Works:**
- When `selectedTextId` exists, **only** `TextPropertiesPanel` is rendered
- Tool instructions, grid settings, and coordinate display are **completely hidden**
- User sees text editing controls immediately at the top of the panel
- No scrolling required, no confusion

### Fix 2: Text Deselection on Empty Click

**File:** `app/src/components/Scene/DrawingCanvas.tsx`

Added text deselection when clicking on empty space with select tool:

```typescript
// Line 387-399
const handleClick = useCallback((event: ThreeEvent<MouseEvent>) => {
  // Handle deselection when select tool is active and clicking empty space
  if (activeTool === 'select') {
    // Clear all selections when clicking empty space
    if (!event.shiftKey) {
      clearSelection();
      exitRotateMode(); // Clear rotation handles when clicking empty space
      // Also deselect any selected text
      useTextStore.getState().selectText(null); // ðŸ‘ˆ NEW LINE
    }
    return;
  }
  // ... rest of click handling
}, [/* dependencies */]);
```

**Why This Is Important:**
- Maintains consistent selection behavior between shapes and text
- Clicking empty space now clears ALL selections (shapes + text)
- Properties panel returns to showing tool instructions
- Prevents "stuck" text selection state

## User Flow After Fix

### Selecting Text
1. User clicks on existing text object â†’ `selectText(textId)` is called
2. Properties Panel immediately shows `TextPropertiesPanel` component
3. User sees text editing controls:
   - Text preview
   - Font size slider (12-72px)
   - Color picker with hex input
   - Text alignment buttons (left/center/right)
   - Font family dropdown
   - Edit Text Content button (opens modal)
   - Lock/Unlock toggle
   - Visibility toggle
   - Delete button

### Deselecting Text
1. User clicks on empty space with select tool
2. Both shape and text selections are cleared
3. Properties Panel returns to showing tool instructions

### Editing Text
1. User clicks "Edit Text Content" button in properties panel
2. Modal opens with full text editor
3. After saving, properties panel updates with new content

## Files Modified

1. **`app/src/components/PropertiesPanel.tsx`** (lines 186-425)
   - Changed conditional rendering from `&&` to ternary operator
   - Wrapped tool instructions in `<>...</>` fragment
   - Made text properties the exclusive view when text is selected

2. **`app/src/components/Scene/DrawingCanvas.tsx`** (line 396)
   - Added `useTextStore.getState().selectText(null)` to empty space click handler
   - Ensures text is deselected along with shapes

## Testing Verification

### Test Cases Passed

âœ… **TC1: Text Selection Shows Properties**
- Click on text â†’ Properties panel shows text editing controls
- No scrolling required to see controls
- Tool instructions are hidden

âœ… **TC2: Text Deselection on Empty Click**
- Select text â†’ click empty space â†’ text is deselected
- Properties panel returns to tool instructions

âœ… **TC3: Text Editing from Properties**
- Select text â†’ click "Edit Text Content" â†’ modal opens
- Edit content â†’ save â†’ properties panel updates

âœ… **TC4: Font Size Adjustment**
- Select text â†’ drag font size slider â†’ text updates in real-time

âœ… **TC5: Color Change**
- Select text â†’ click color picker â†’ text color updates immediately

âœ… **TC6: Text Alignment**
- Select text â†’ click alignment button â†’ text alignment changes

âœ… **TC7: Lock/Unlock Toggle**
- Select text â†’ click lock â†’ text becomes locked
- Delete button becomes disabled

âœ… **TC8: Delete Text**
- Select unlocked text â†’ click delete â†’ text is removed

## Design Patterns Applied

### 1. Priority View Pattern
When a specific entity is selected (text), show its properties exclusively:
```typescript
{selectedEntity ? <EntityProperties /> : <DefaultView />}
```

### 2. Centralized State Management
All selection state managed through Zustand stores:
- `useTextStore` for text selection
- `useAppStore` for shape selection

### 3. Atomic Deselection
Single source of truth for clearing selections:
```typescript
clearSelection(); // Shapes
selectText(null); // Text
```

## Accessibility Improvements

âœ… **Keyboard Navigation**
- All controls in TextPropertiesPanel are keyboard accessible
- Tab order follows logical flow

âœ… **Visual Feedback**
- Selected text has blue border and shadow
- Button states clearly indicate active/inactive

âœ… **Screen Reader Support**
- All buttons have descriptive labels
- Form inputs have associated labels

## Performance Considerations

âœ… **No Performance Impact**
- Conditional rendering reduces DOM elements when text selected
- Less elements = better performance
- No additional re-renders introduced

âœ… **Efficient State Updates**
- Direct store access using `getState()` in callbacks
- Avoids stale closure issues
- Single update for all selection clearing

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Multi-text selection** - Edit multiple text objects at once
2. **Text property presets** - Save commonly used text styles
3. **Font weight/style controls** - Bold, italic, underline
4. **Text shadow/outline** - Advanced visual effects
5. **Text rotation widget** - Visual rotation control in properties panel

### Edge Cases to Consider
- What happens when both shape and text are selected? (Currently: last selection wins)
- Should text properties show alongside shape properties? (Current behavior: exclusive)
- Multi-selection behavior for text objects? (Currently: single selection only)

## Conclusion

The Properties Panel now correctly displays text editing controls when text is selected, providing a smooth, intuitive user experience that matches modern design tools like Canva and Figma. The fix maintains consistency with the existing shape selection behavior and improves overall UX by eliminating confusion and unnecessary scrolling.
