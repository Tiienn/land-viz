# Rotation and Resize Distortion Bug Fix

**Date**: October 20, 2025
**Issue**: After rotating a rectangle, using resize handles causes distortion. After resizing, rotation causes distortion.
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

---

## Executive Summary

Fixed critical coordinate space mismatch bug in the Land Visualizer application that caused shape distortion when performing resize operations after rotation, or rotation operations after resize.

**Root Cause**: The `validateShapeIntegrity()` function was converting all 2-point rectangles to 4-point format during undo/redo operations, breaking the single-selection rotation model which relies on 2-point format + rotation metadata.

**Impact**: All rotation and resize operations now work correctly without distortion for both single-selection and multi-selection scenarios.

---

## Problem Analysis

### User-Reported Issues

1. **After rotating a rectangle, resize causes distortion**: Dragging resize handles on a rotated rectangle would stretch/skew the shape instead of resizing it properly.

2. **After resizing a rectangle, rotation causes distortion**: Rotating a resized rectangle would distort the shape instead of rotating it smoothly.

3. **Console logs showed 4-point rectangles**: After rotation, rectangles were being stored with 4 points instead of the expected 2 points for single selection.

### Coordinate Space Model

The application uses two different coordinate space models:

#### Single-Selection Model (2-point format + metadata)
- **Points**: Stored in LOCAL space (unrotated) as `[topLeft, bottomRight]`
- **Rotation**: Stored as metadata `{ angle: number, center: Point2D }`
- **Rendering**: ShapeRenderer applies rotation transform during rendering
- **Advantages**: Efficient, preserves original geometry, easy undo/redo

#### Multi-Selection Model (4-point format)
- **Points**: Stored in WORLD space (already rotated) as `[topLeft, topRight, bottomRight, bottomLeft]`
- **Rotation**: Each shape has rotation metadata for its own rotation around group center
- **Rendering**: Points are already in final positions
- **Advantages**: Supports group rotation around collective center (Canva-style)

### Root Cause

The bug was caused by `validateShapeIntegrity()` function in `useAppStore.ts` (lines 2505-2516):

```typescript
// BUGGY CODE (REMOVED):
} else if (validatedShape.points.length === 2) {
  // Convert 2-point format to 4-point format for consistency
  const [topLeft, bottomRight] = validatedShape.points;
  return {
    ...validatedShape,
    points: [
      { x: topLeft.x, y: topLeft.y },      // Top left
      { x: bottomRight.x, y: topLeft.y },  // Top right
      { x: bottomRight.x, y: bottomRight.y }, // Bottom right
      { x: topLeft.x, y: bottomRight.y }   // Bottom left
    ]
  };
}
```

**Why this was problematic:**
1. After rotation, the shape correctly had 2 points + rotation metadata
2. When undo/redo occurred, `validateShapeIntegrity()` ran on history restore
3. It converted the 2-point format to 4-point format "for consistency"
4. This broke the coordinate space model - now we had 4 points (LOCAL space) + rotation metadata
5. ResizableShapeControls didn't know if 4-point format meant:
   - Multi-selection (WORLD space, no inverse rotation needed)
   - Or corrupted single-selection (LOCAL space, inverse rotation needed)
6. Wrong assumptions led to applying or not applying inverse rotation incorrectly
7. Result: distortion during resize or rotation

## The Fix

### 1. Remove Point Format Conversion (PRIMARY FIX)

**File**: `app/src/store/useAppStore.ts`
**Lines**: 2491-2508

```typescript
// FIXED CODE:
// Handle rectangles - ensure they have the correct structure
if (validatedShape.type === 'rectangle') {
  // CRITICAL FIX: DO NOT convert between 2-point and 4-point formats
  // - Single-selection rotation uses 2-point format + rotation metadata
  // - Multi-selection rotation uses 4-point format (points already transformed)
  // - Converting between formats breaks coordinate space assumptions

  if (validatedShape.points.length === 4) {
    // Keep 4-point format as-is (multi-selection case)
    return {
      ...validatedShape,
      points: validatedShape.points.slice(0, 4)
    };
  } else if (validatedShape.points.length === 2) {
    // Keep 2-point format as-is (single-selection case)
    return validatedShape;
  }
}
```

**Why this works:**
- Preserves the intended coordinate space model for each selection type
- Single-selection shapes keep 2-point format forever
- Multi-selection shapes keep 4-point format forever
- No more ambiguity about what point format means

### 2. Enhanced Inverse Rotation Logic

**File**: `app/src/components/Scene/ResizableShapeControls.tsx`
**Lines**: 685-717 (handlePointerMove) and 851-871 (handlePointerUp)

```typescript
// ENHANCED CODE:
// COORDINATE SPACE FIX:
// - Mouse position is in WORLD space
// - For SINGLE-selection rotated shapes: points are in LOCAL space, rotation is metadata
// - For MULTI-selection rotated shapes: points are in WORLD space (already transformed)
// - We need to convert mouse WORLD position to LOCAL space for single-selection resizing
let newPoint: Point2D = { x: intersection.x, y: intersection.z };

// Apply inverse rotation ONLY if this is a single-selection rotated shape
if (dragState.current.shapeRotation && dragState.current.shapeRotation.angle !== 0) {
  const rotation = dragState.current.shapeRotation;

  // Check if this is single or multi-selection by looking at original points format
  // Single-selection: 2-point rectangle format with rotation metadata
  // Multi-selection: Points already transformed to world space
  const isSingleSelectionRotated = dragState.current.originalPoints.length === 2;

  if (isSingleSelectionRotated) {
    // Apply inverse rotation to convert mouse world position to shape's local space
    const angleRadians = (-rotation.angle * Math.PI) / 180; // Negative for inverse
    const cos = Math.cos(angleRadians);
    const sin = Math.sin(angleRadians);

    const dx = newPoint.x - rotation.center.x;
    const dy = newPoint.y - rotation.center.y;

    newPoint = {
      x: rotation.center.x + (dx * cos - dy * sin),
      y: rotation.center.y + (dx * sin + dy * cos)
    };
  }
  // else: Multi-selection or no rotation - use world coordinates directly
}
```

**Why this works:**
- Detects single vs multi-selection by checking point array length (2 = single, 4 = multi)
- Only applies inverse rotation for single-selection case (LOCAL space points)
- Multi-selection uses mouse world coordinates directly (WORLD space points)
- No more distortion from incorrect coordinate space conversions

### 3. Cleanup Debug Statements

**File**: `app/src/components/Scene/ResizableShapeControls.tsx`

Removed console.log statements:
- Line 976-980: "üîç 4-point rectangle detected"
- Line 997: "üì¶ Final 2-point format"
- Line 1002-1007: "üéØ RESIZE START"

Added clear inline comments explaining coordinate spaces instead.

## Test Scenarios

All test scenarios now work correctly:

### ‚úÖ Scenario 1: Create ‚Üí Rotate ‚Üí Resize
1. Create rectangle (2-point format)
2. Rotate 45¬∞ (2-point + rotation metadata)
3. Resize (inverse rotation applied, works in LOCAL space)
4. Result: **No distortion**, shape resizes correctly

### ‚úÖ Scenario 2: Create ‚Üí Resize ‚Üí Rotate
1. Create rectangle (2-point format)
2. Resize to new dimensions (stays 2-point format)
3. Rotate 45¬∞ (2-point + rotation metadata, center recalculated)
4. Result: **No distortion**, shape rotates correctly

### ‚úÖ Scenario 3: Create ‚Üí Rotate ‚Üí Resize ‚Üí Rotate Again
1. Create rectangle (2-point format)
2. Rotate 45¬∞ (2-point + rotation metadata)
3. Resize (inverse rotation applied, stays 2-point format)
4. Rotate to 90¬∞ (rotation metadata updated, center recalculated)
5. Result: **No distortion**, all operations work smoothly

### ‚úÖ Scenario 4: Multi-Selection Rotation ‚Üí Resize
1. Select 2+ rectangles
2. Rotate group 45¬∞ (all shapes ‚Üí 4-point WORLD space format)
3. Resize individual shape (NO inverse rotation, uses WORLD coordinates)
4. Result: **No distortion**, multi-selection works correctly

### ‚úÖ Scenario 5: Undo/Redo After Rotation
1. Create and rotate rectangle
2. Press Ctrl+Z (undo)
3. Shape returns to pre-rotation state (validateShapeIntegrity preserves 2-point)
4. Press Ctrl+Y (redo)
5. Shape returns to rotated state (validateShapeIntegrity preserves 2-point)
6. Result: **No format conversion**, coordinate space preserved

## Technical Details

### Coordinate Space Transformation Math

For single-selection resizing of rotated shapes, we apply **inverse rotation** to convert mouse WORLD coordinates to shape LOCAL coordinates:

```typescript
// Forward rotation (rendering): LOCAL ‚Üí WORLD
x_world = center.x + (x_local - center.x) * cos(Œ∏) - (y_local - center.y) * sin(Œ∏)
y_world = center.y + (x_local - center.x) * sin(Œ∏) + (y_local - center.y) * cos(Œ∏)

// Inverse rotation (resize input): WORLD ‚Üí LOCAL
x_local = center.x + (x_world - center.x) * cos(-Œ∏) - (y_world - center.y) * sin(-Œ∏)
y_local = center.y + (x_world - center.x) * sin(-Œ∏) + (y_world - center.y) * cos(-Œ∏)

// Since cos(-Œ∏) = cos(Œ∏) and sin(-Œ∏) = -sin(Œ∏):
x_local = center.x + (x_world - center.x) * cos(Œ∏) + (y_world - center.y) * sin(Œ∏)
y_local = center.y - (x_world - center.x) * sin(Œ∏) + (y_world - center.y) * cos(Œ∏)
```

## Key Learnings

### 1. Never Auto-Convert Coordinate Formats
**Lesson**: Format conversions should be explicit and intentional, never automatic in "validation" functions.

**Why**: Different formats represent different coordinate space models. Converting between them breaks semantic meaning.

### 2. Document Coordinate Space Assumptions
**Lesson**: Every point array should have a clear comment explaining what coordinate space it's in.

**Example**:
```typescript
// COORDINATE SPACE: LOCAL (unrotated, 2-point format for single-selection)
const originalPoints = [topLeft, bottomRight];

// COORDINATE SPACE: WORLD (already rotated, 4-point format for multi-selection)
const transformedPoints = [topLeft, topRight, bottomRight, bottomLeft];
```

### 3. Use Point Array Length as Signal
**Lesson**: Point array length can be a reliable signal for coordinate space:
- `length === 2`: Single-selection, LOCAL space
- `length === 4`: Multi-selection, WORLD space

**Why**: This creates a clear, testable contract that's easy to verify.

### 4. Inverse Transformations Need Context
**Lesson**: Before applying inverse transformations, always check if they're needed based on the coordinate space.

**Anti-pattern**: Always applying inverse rotation regardless of context
**Good pattern**: Check point format first, then decide if inverse rotation is needed

---

## Performance Impact

**Zero performance impact**:
- Removed unnecessary point conversions (performance gain)
- Added single conditional check (negligible cost)
- No new loops or heavy computations

---

## Backward Compatibility

**Fully backward compatible**:
- Existing 2-point rectangles continue to work (single-selection model)
- Existing 4-point rectangles continue to work (multi-selection model)
- No migration needed for existing user data
- Undo/redo history preserves original formats

---

## Future Recommendations

### 1. Type-Safe Coordinate Spaces

Consider using TypeScript discriminated unions to make coordinate spaces explicit:

```typescript
type LocalPoints = {
  space: 'local';
  format: '2-point';
  points: [Point2D, Point2D];
  rotation?: { angle: number; center: Point2D };
};

type WorldPoints = {
  space: 'world';
  format: '4-point';
  points: [Point2D, Point2D, Point2D, Point2D];
};

type RectanglePoints = LocalPoints | WorldPoints;
```

### 2. Unit Tests for Coordinate Transformations

Add comprehensive tests for:
- Forward rotation transformation (LOCAL ‚Üí WORLD)
- Inverse rotation transformation (WORLD ‚Üí LOCAL)
- Round-trip transformation (LOCAL ‚Üí WORLD ‚Üí LOCAL should equal original)
- Edge cases: 0¬∞, 90¬∞, 180¬∞, 270¬∞, 360¬∞ rotations

### 3. Visual Debugging Tool

Create a debug overlay that shows:
- Current point format (2-point vs 4-point)
- Coordinate space (LOCAL vs WORLD)
- Rotation metadata
- Bounding boxes in both coordinate spaces
