# 2D Camera Compression Fix (Complete)

**Date:** January 30, 2025
**Status:** ✅ FULLY RESOLVED
**Severity:** High - Affects core drawing functionality in 2D mode

**Issue:** When drawing shapes (rectangles, circles, polylines) in 2D orthographic mode, the grid and all existing shapes would compress/shrink unexpectedly, requiring manual zoom adjustment to return to normal view. This happened EVERY time a shape was drawn.

---

## Problem Summary

When users worked in 2D mode and drew any shape:
1. **Grid and shapes compressed** - Everything appeared 5x smaller than before
2. **Happened on every draw** - Any shape creation triggered the compression
3. **Required manual zoom recovery** - Users had to scroll to zoom back to normal view
4. **Extremely disruptive** - Made 2D drawing workflow unusable

**Visual Impact:**
```
Normal view:  [████████]  Grid cells are 1m squares
                ↓ (draw a rectangle)
Compressed:   [▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪]  Grid cells appear tiny, everything shrinks
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Real Problem: Orthographic Camera Bounds Resetting

**Initial Misdiagnosis:** First assumed camera.zoom was being reset to 1.0 (based on previous debugging sessions with similar symptoms).

**Actual Root Cause:** React Three Fiber's `<OrthographicCamera>` component was **resetting the camera's frustum bounds** (left/right/top/bottom properties) when the component re-rendered.

**Trigger:** Adding a shape to Zustand store → Zustand notifies subscribers → React Three Fiber re-renders `<OrthographicCamera>` → Bounds reset

**Debug Logs Revealed:**
```typescript
// Before drawing (normal):
left: -91.41435237485864
right: 91.41435237485864
camera.zoom: 0.463

// During compression (after drawing):
left: -440.8000183105469   // 5X LARGER!
right: 440.8000183105469   // 5X LARGER!
camera.zoom: 0.540         // Zoom stayed stable!

// The problem was NOT zoom - it was BOUNDS
// Bounds jumping 5x wider made everything appear 5x smaller (compressed)
```

### Technical Details

**Orthographic Camera Bounds:**
- Define the viewing frustum (what portion of the world is visible)
- Calculated based on viewport aspect ratio: `left = -aspect * viewSize / 2`
- Combined with `camera.zoom` to determine final view scale
- When bounds jump from ~91 to ~440, the visible area becomes 5x larger
- Result: Everything in view appears 5x smaller (compressed)

**Why React Three Fiber Resets Bounds:**
- React Three Fiber declaratively manages Three.js objects
- On re-render, it rebuilds camera properties from component props
- The `<OrthographicCamera>` component doesn't preserve internal camera state
- Any state update (like adding a shape to Zustand) triggers re-render
- Camera bounds get recalculated from scratch using `orthoBounds` useMemo

**Why zoom2D Wasn't The Problem:**
- camera.zoom stayed stable (0.463 → 0.540)
- The zoom restoration mechanism (added previously) was working correctly
- But bounds were never being tracked or restored

---

## The Solution

### Two-Part Restoration Mechanism

**Part 1: Zoom Restoration** (Already Existed)
- Tracks camera.zoom in a ref (`currentZoomRef`)
- Detects when zoom resets to 1.0 (default)
- Immediately restores zoom from the ref
- Runs after every render (useEffect with no dependencies)

**Part 2: Bounds Restoration** (NEW - The Key Fix)
- Tracks camera bounds (left/right/top/bottom) in a ref (`currentBoundsRef`)
- Validates bounds are valid numbers before any calculations
- Detects when bounds change significantly (>1 unit delta)
- Immediately restores bounds from the ref
- Runs after every render (useEffect with no dependencies)

### Implementation

**File:** `app/src/components/Scene/Camera2DToggle.tsx`

**1. Added Bounds Tracking Ref** (Lines 20-26):
```typescript
// Track the current bounds to restore them after React re-renders
const currentBoundsRef = useRef<{
  left: number;
  right: number;
  top: number;
  bottom: number;
} | null>(null);
```

**2. Added Bounds Restoration Logic** (Lines 81-137):
```typescript
// CRITICAL FIX: Restore zoom AND bounds on every render to prevent React Three Fiber from resetting them
// This runs after EVERY render to ensure they are preserved when shapes are added/removed
useEffect(() => {
  if (is2DMode && camera && 'zoom' in camera) {
    const orthoCamera = camera as THREE.OrthographicCamera;
    let needsUpdate = false;

    // 1. Check and restore ZOOM
    const currentCameraZoom = camera.zoom;

    // If camera zoom was reset to 1 (default), restore it from our ref
    if (Math.abs(currentCameraZoom - 1.0) < 0.01 && Math.abs(currentZoomRef.current - 1.0) > 0.01) {
      camera.zoom = currentZoomRef.current;
      needsUpdate = true;
    } else if (Math.abs(currentCameraZoom - currentZoomRef.current) > 0.01) {
      currentZoomRef.current = currentCameraZoom;
    }

    // 2. Check and restore BOUNDS (THIS IS THE KEY FIX!)
    const currentBounds = {
      left: orthoCamera.left,
      right: orthoCamera.right,
      top: orthoCamera.top,
      bottom: orthoCamera.bottom
    };

    // Validate that currentBounds has valid numbers
    const boundsAreValid =
      typeof currentBounds.left === 'number' && !isNaN(currentBounds.left) &&
      typeof currentBounds.right === 'number' && !isNaN(currentBounds.right) &&
      typeof currentBounds.top === 'number' && !isNaN(currentBounds.top) &&
      typeof currentBounds.bottom === 'number' && !isNaN(currentBounds.bottom);

    // If we have a previous bounds reference, check if they've changed unexpectedly
    if (currentBoundsRef.current && boundsAreValid) {
      const leftDelta = Math.abs(currentBounds.left - currentBoundsRef.current.left);
      const rightDelta = Math.abs(currentBounds.right - currentBoundsRef.current.right);

      // If bounds changed significantly (more than 1 unit), restore from ref
      if (!isNaN(leftDelta) && !isNaN(rightDelta) && (leftDelta > 1 || rightDelta > 1)) {
        orthoCamera.left = currentBoundsRef.current.left;
        orthoCamera.right = currentBoundsRef.current.right;
        orthoCamera.top = currentBoundsRef.current.top;
        orthoCamera.bottom = currentBoundsRef.current.bottom;
        needsUpdate = true;
      }
    } else if (boundsAreValid) {
      // First time or ref was invalid, store the bounds if they're valid
      currentBoundsRef.current = currentBounds;
    }

    // Update projection matrix if anything changed
    if (needsUpdate) {
      camera.updateProjectionMatrix();
    }
  }
}); // No dependencies - runs after EVERY render
```

**3. Reset Bounds Ref on Mode Switch** (Line 75):
```typescript
// Reset the bounds ref when switching to 2D mode
// It will be populated on the next render by the restoration useEffect
currentBoundsRef.current = null;
```

## Debugging Process

### Phase 1: Initial Misdiagnosis
**Assumption:** Camera.zoom was being reset to 1.0
**Approach:** Modified mode switching logic to restore zoom
**Result:** ❌ Grid compression persisted

### Phase 2: Agent Consultation
**Action:** Invoked 3d-scene-specialist agent
**Result:** ❌ Agent created extensive documentation but didn't apply actual fixes

### Phase 3: Dependency Array Fix
**Action:** Removed zoom2D from useEffect dependency array
**Reason:** Prevent feedback loops causing excessive re-renders
**Result:** ✅ Performance improved, ❌ Compression persisted

### Phase 4: Debug Logging
**User Request:** "The issue still persist. lets debug it through debug logs"
**Action:** Added comprehensive console.log statements tracking:
- Component renders
- Camera properties (zoom, position, rotation, bounds)
- Orthographic bounds calculations
- Zoom restoration attempts

**Key Discovery:**
```typescript
// Debug output showing the REAL problem:
📊 BOUNDS DELTA CHECK:
leftDelta: NaN        // ❌ Can't detect changes with NaN!
rightDelta: NaN

// After fixing NaN issue:
📊 BOUNDS DELTA CHECK:
leftDelta: 349.39      // ✅ Detected 349 unit jump!
rightDelta: 349.39     // Bounds jumped from ~91 to ~440
```

### Phase 5: Bounds Restoration (First Attempt)
**Action:** Added bounds tracking and restoration mechanism
**Result:** ❌ NaN values prevented detection of bounds changes
**Problem:**
- Attempted to read camera bounds too early
- `currentBoundsRef.current` was null
- `Math.abs(number - null)` = NaN

### Phase 6: NaN Fix (Final Solution)
**Action:** Added validation before calculations:
```typescript
// Validate that currentBounds has valid numbers
const boundsAreValid =
  typeof currentBounds.left === 'number' && !isNaN(currentBounds.left) &&
  typeof currentBounds.right === 'number' && !isNaN(currentBounds.right) &&
  typeof currentBounds.top === 'number' && !isNaN(currentBounds.top) &&
  typeof currentBounds.bottom === 'number' && !isNaN(currentBounds.bottom);

// Only calculate deltas if bounds are valid
if (currentBoundsRef.current && boundsAreValid) {
  const leftDelta = Math.abs(currentBounds.left - currentBoundsRef.current.left);
  const rightDelta = Math.abs(currentBounds.right - currentBoundsRef.current.right);

  // Additional NaN check before comparison
  if (!isNaN(leftDelta) && !isNaN(rightDelta) && (leftDelta > 1 || rightDelta > 1)) {
    // Restore bounds...
  }
}
```

**Result:** ✅ **PERFECT FIX!** User confirmed: "Perfect its fix now."

## Errors Encountered and Fixed

### Error 1: NaN Values in Bounds Delta
**Console Output:**
```
📊 BOUNDS DELTA CHECK: leftDelta: NaN, rightDelta: NaN
```

**Cause:**
- `currentBoundsRef.current` was null
- Attempted math: `Math.abs(number - null)` = NaN

**Fix:**
1. Added `boundsAreValid` validation before any calculations
2. Only store bounds when they're valid numbers
3. Added NaN checks before comparisons
4. Removed early bounds storage from mode switch useEffect

### Error 2: Initial Misdiagnosis (Zoom vs Bounds)
**Symptom:** Grid compression
**Assumed Cause:** camera.zoom resetting
**Actual Cause:** Orthographic bounds jumping 5x

**How Discovered:**
- Debug logs showed zoom stayed stable (0.463 → 0.540)
- Bounds jumped dramatically (-91 → -440)
- Realized bounds were the actual problem

**Learning:** Don't assume the cause - always instrument and measure first!

### Error 3: Feedback Loop (Secondary Issue)
**Symptom:** 60 re-renders per second during scrolling
**Cause:** CameraController syncing zoom to store on every frame
**Fix:** Added 100ms debouncing to zoom sync

## Key Learnings

### 1. React Three Fiber State Management
**Problem:** React Three Fiber doesn't preserve Three.js object state across re-renders
**Solution:** Use refs to track camera properties and restore them after renders
**Pattern:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // Detect if React reset the property
  if (camera.property !== expectedValue) {
    // Restore from ref
    camera.property = storedRef.current;
    camera.updateProjectionMatrix();
  }
}); // No dependencies - runs after EVERY render
```

### 2. Validation is Critical
**Problem:** Math operations with null/undefined produce NaN
**Solution:** Always validate values before calculations
**Pattern:**
```typescript
const isValid =
  typeof value === 'number' &&
  !isNaN(value);

if (isValid) {
  // Safe to use value
}
```

### 3. Debug Logs Are Essential
**Problem:** Can't fix what you can't see
**Solution:** Add comprehensive logging to track state changes
**Best Practice:**
```typescript
console.log('📊 VARIABLE_NAME:', variable, 'type:', typeof variable);
console.log('📊 BOUNDS DELTA:', { leftDelta, rightDelta });
```

**Cleanup:** Always remove debug logs after fix is confirmed!

## Prevention Guidelines

### If This Issue Happens Again

**Symptoms:**
- Grid/shapes compress when drawing in 2D mode
- Everything appears smaller/zoomed out unexpectedly
- Requires manual zoom to recover

**Diagnostic Steps:**

1. **Add Debug Logging**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('📊 CAMERA STATE:', {
    zoom: camera.zoom,
    left: camera.left,
    right: camera.right,
    top: camera.top,
    bottom: camera.bottom,
    position: camera.position.toArray()
  });
});
```

2. **Check Bounds vs Zoom**
- If bounds stay stable (~90-100) but zoom changes → Zoom issue
- If zoom stays stable but bounds jump (>200) → Bounds issue

3. **Verify Restoration Logic**
- Check that restoration useEffect has no dependencies
- Verify refs are being populated with valid numbers
- Confirm NaN checks are present

4. **Check React Three Fiber Version**
- Breaking changes in R3F might affect camera management
- Review R3F changelog for camera-related changes

### Code Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Don't:** Add camera properties to useEffect dependencies
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // ...
}, [camera.zoom, camera.left]); // Creates feedback loop!
```

✅ **Do:** Use no dependencies for restoration logic
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // Runs after every render - catches all resets
}); // No dependencies
```

❌ **Don't:** Assume values are valid numbers
```typescript
const delta = Math.abs(currentValue - refValue); // NaN if ref is null!
```

✅ **Do:** Validate before calculations
```typescript
const isValid = typeof value === 'number' && !isNaN(value);
if (isValid) {
  const delta = Math.abs(currentValue - refValue);
}
```

## Future Considerations

### Potential Improvements
1. **Camera State Persistence**
   - Save camera bounds to localStorage
   - Restore on app reload

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Track bounds reset frequency
   - Alert if resets exceed threshold

3. **Alternative Approach**
   - Consider using Three.js camera directly (not via R3F component)
   - Might eliminate re-render issues entirely

4. **React Three Fiber Updates**
   - Monitor R3F releases for built-in camera state preservation
   - May be able to remove manual restoration in future versions
