# Text Tool 2D Mode Fix

**Date**: January 13, 2025
**Issue**: Text tool not working in 2D mode - clicking canvas after activating text tool did nothing
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

## Problem

When in 2D mode:
1. Click Text button in ribbon → Tool activates ✅
2. Click canvas → Nothing happens ❌
3. No inline text editor appears
4. No error in console

The text tool worked fine in 3D mode but completely failed in 2D mode.

## Root Cause

**Coordinate system mismatch** between 2D ground plane and 3D text position.

### The Issue

In Land Visualizer's architecture:
- **2D canvas coordinates**: `{x: number, y: number}` where:
  - `x` = X axis (left-right)
  - `y` = Z axis (forward-back) in 3D space

- **3D TextPosition**: `{x: number, y: number, z: number}` where:
  - `x` = X axis (left-right)
  - `y` = Y axis (up-down, height)
  - `z` = Z axis (forward-back)

### The Bug

**DrawingCanvas.tsx** (lines 677-684) was incorrectly creating text positions:

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Before fix
const textPosition = {
  x: snappedPos.x,
  y: snappedPos.y,  // This is actually Z coordinate!
  z: 0.1            // This should be height
};
```

This caused the text to be positioned at ground level (y=Z value), floating off into space at height `z=0.1`, completely invisible in 2D view.

**InlineTextEditor.tsx** and **TextObject.tsx** also had the wrong mapping:

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Before fix
<Html position={[text.position.x, text.position.z, -text.position.y]} />
```

## Solution

### Fix #1: DrawingCanvas.tsx (lines 677-684)

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - After fix
const textPosition = {
  x: snappedPos.x,     // X coordinate
  y: 0.1,              // Height above grid (Y axis)
  z: snappedPos.y      // Z coordinate (2D Y maps to 3D Z)
};
```

Added clear comments explaining the coordinate mapping:
```typescript
// Create text position
// snappedPos is a 2D point where x=X and y=Z (the horizontal plane)
// TextPosition is {x, y (height), z} for 3D space
```

### Fix #2: InlineTextEditor.tsx (line 138)

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - After fix
<Html position={[position.x, position.y, position.z]} />
```

Direct 1:1 mapping - no coordinate swapping needed.

### Fix #3: TextObject.tsx (line 53)

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - After fix
<Html position={[text.position.x, text.position.y, text.position.z]} />
```

Same direct mapping as InlineTextEditor.

## Files Modified

1. **app/src/components/Scene/DrawingCanvas.tsx**
   - Lines 677-684: Fixed text position creation
   - Added explanatory comments

2. **app/src/components/Text/InlineTextEditor.tsx**
   - Line 138: Fixed Html position prop

3. **app/src/components/Text/TextObject.tsx**
   - Line 53: Fixed Html position prop

## Testing

### Before Fix
- 2D mode: Click Text → Click canvas → Nothing happens ❌
- 3D mode: Click Text → Click canvas → Editor appears ✅

### After Fix
- 2D mode: Click Text → Click canvas → Editor appears ✅
- 3D mode: Click Text → Click canvas → Editor appears ✅
- Text positioning accurate in both modes ✅

### Test Steps

1. Open application: http://localhost:5173
2. **Test 2D Mode**:
   - Press `V` to toggle to 2D view
   - Click Text button in ribbon
   - Click anywhere on canvas
   - ✅ Inline text editor should appear at click position
   - Type "Test" and press ESC
   - ✅ Text should appear at correct location

3. **Test 3D Mode**:
   - Press `V` to toggle to 3D view
   - Click Text button
   - Click canvas
   - ✅ Inline text editor should appear
   - Type "Test 3D" and press ESC
   - ✅ Text should appear at correct location

4. **Verify Positioning**:
   - Create text in 2D mode
   - Toggle to 3D mode
   - ✅ Text should be at same ground position
   - Toggle back to 2D
   - ✅ Text still at correct position

## Technical Notes

### Coordinate System Explanation

Land Visualizer uses a **hybrid 2D/3D coordinate system**:

```
2D Canvas (DrawingCanvas clicks):
  Point2D { x: number, y: number }
  - x = horizontal (left-right)
  - y = depth (forward-back) → Maps to 3D Z

3D Space (Three.js):
  Vector3 [x, y, z]
  - x = horizontal (left-right)
  - y = vertical (up-down) → Height
  - z = depth (forward-back)

Mapping:
  2D.x → 3D.x ✅
  2D.y → 3D.z ✅ (THIS WAS THE BUG!)
  Height = 0.1 (above ground)
```

### Why This Bug Existed

The original code likely copied patterns from shape creation (rectangles, circles) which handle 2D-to-3D differently:
- Shapes are rendered on the ground plane (y=0)
- Text needs to float slightly above (y=0.1) for visibility
- The Y/Z swap wasn't properly accounted for when porting the code

### Prevention

Added comments in DrawingCanvas.tsx to prevent regression:
```typescript
// Create text position
// snappedPos is a 2D point where x=X and y=Z (the horizontal plane)
// TextPosition is {x, y (height), z} for 3D space
```

## Related Issues

None - this was an isolated coordinate mapping bug.

## Future Improvements

1. **Type Safety**: Consider creating explicit conversion functions:
   ```typescript
   function point2DToTextPosition(point2D: Point2D, height: number = 0.1): TextPosition {
     return {
       x: point2D.x,
       y: height,
       z: point2D.y
     };
   }
   ```

2. **Validation**: Add runtime checks to ensure text positions are reasonable:
   ```typescript
   if (Math.abs(position.y) > 100) {
     logger.warn('Text position Y is suspiciously large', position);
   }
   ```

3. **Documentation**: Update architecture docs to clearly explain 2D/3D coordinate mapping

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Text tool works in 2D mode
- [x] Text tool works in 3D mode
- [x] Text positioning accurate in both modes
- [x] Existing texts still render correctly
- [x] No console errors
- [x] Code comments added for clarity
- [x] All three components fixed (DrawingCanvas, InlineTextEditor, TextObject)

## Conclusion

Simple but critical coordinate system fix. The text tool is now fully functional in both 2D and 3D modes. The bug was caused by incorrect Y/Z coordinate mapping when converting from 2D canvas clicks to 3D text positions.

**Impact**: Medium priority bug → High user frustration (feature appeared broken)
**Complexity**: Low (3 line changes + comments)
**Risk**: Very low (isolated coordinate mapping fix)
**Testing**: Manual testing sufficient (coordinate math is deterministic)
